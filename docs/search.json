    "text": "Manipulating Data with {dplyr}\nNow that we know how to set up a project and import data, we can finally start to play around with it. Going forward we will be using several packages from the “tidyverse” to help us manipulate, summarize, and visualize our data. Today’s session will focus on data manipulation using a package called {dplyr}.\n\nWhat is {dplyr}\nData manipulation is the foundation of working with data in R and as such is foundational to the work we do as epidemiologists. In particular, data manipulation skills will be critical when trying clean our data.\nIn R, the package {dplyr} provides a large number of functions to help us manipulate dataframes and perform many of the tasks that we will need to use on a daily basis, for example:\n\nSubsetting our data to remove certain variables\nRenaming certain variables\nAdding or modifying a variable\nRemoving duplicate entries\n\nIn {dplyr} each of these actions can be done with a particular function, which typically have an intuitive verb for a name. For example, renaming columns will use the function rename().\nIn today’s session we will look at the “data manipulation verb”, ie the function, needed for each of the above tasks as well as how to chain them all together into an efficient data pipeline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou may have noticed that we asked you to load a package called {tidyverse} rather than {dplyr} in the setup. Loading {tidyverse} will load several of the most useful packages from the broader tidyverse, including {dplyr} and a couple other packages that we will see later in the session."

    "section": "Basic Data Verbs",
    "text": "Basic Data Verbs\n\nSelecting Specific Columns\nA lot of the time when we receive a dataset it will have extra columns that we don’t need, either because those columns contain sensitive data or because our analysis will only focus on a subset of the data. This is where a function like select() comes in handy.\nHere is the basic syntax, note that this is pseudo-code and isn’t something you are intended to run yourself.\n\n# DO NOT RUN (PSEUDO-CODE)\nselect(df_raw, first_column_to_keep, second_column_to_keep)\n\nHere we see that the first argument is our dataset and each subsequent argumen is the name of a column that we would like to keep. In the tidyverse, variables (ie column names) don’t need to be put into quotation marks. So for example, if we want to select the columns id, sex, and age we can use the following:\n\nselect(df_raw, id, sex, age)\n\n\nUse select() to select the following variables in your dataset: id, sex, age, sub_prefecture, date_onset, and outcome. The head of your output should look something like this:\n\n\n  id   sex age date_onset   outcome\n1  1 femme  36 2022-08-13 recovered\n2  2     f   5 2022-08-18      &lt;NA&gt;\n3  3     f 156 2022-08-17 recovered\n4  6 homme   8 2022-08-22 recovered\n5  7     m   7 2022-08-30 recovered\n6 10     m   4 2022-08-30 recovered\n\n\n Take a look at this output and then at df_raw. We can see that df_raw still contains all of the columns, which is what we want. But can you tell why it didn’t change?\n\nOften, we want to keep most of the variables in our dataset and only remove one or two. We can use the above syntax to do this, but it can become pretty tedious to write out every column name. In these cases, instead of telling select what to **keep**, we can use a subtraction sign (-) to tell it what to **remove**. For example, if we wanted to remove thevillage_commune` column from our dataframe we can use the following:\n\nselect(df_raw, -village_commune)\n\nWay easier!\n\nUse the - syntax in select() to select all of the columns in df_raw except: full_name and age_unit from your dataset.\n\n\n\nRenaming Columns\nAnother common issue when we get new datasets is that the variable names are inconvenient. In those cases, rename() can work wonders. Here’s the basic syntax:\n\n# DO NOT RUN (PSEUDO CODE)\nrename(df,\n       new_column_name = old_column_name,\n       another_new_name = another_old_name)\n\nAs in the case of select(), and indeed in essentially all {dplyr} verbs, the first argument is our daframe. Then each subsequent argument is a statement of new_column_name = old_column_name telling R which columns to rename and the new names that we want to use, with each pair given it’s own line to improve readability. If we wanted to change village_commune to simply be village, for example, we can write:\n\nrename(df_raw,\n       village = village_commune)\n\n\nUse rename() on df_raw to change the columns sub_prefecture, village_commune, and health_facility_name to be prefecture, village, and facility respectively.\n\nIn the above exercise it may have been difficult to check if the output looked correct because R would have printed out the full dataframe. In these cases it can be helpful to create a temporary object just to check if everything looks alright. You can call this object whatever you want, but a common name is tmp.\n\nRepeat the last exercise but this time assign the output to an object called tmp and use names() to check that the column names changed as you expected. The output of names() should give you something like this:\n\n\n [1] \"id\"                \"full_name\"         \"sex\"              \n [4] \"age\"               \"age_unit\"          \"region\"           \n [7] \"prefecture\"        \"village\"           \"date_onset\"       \n[10] \"date_consultation\" \"hospitalisation\"   \"date_admission\"   \n[13] \"facility\"          \"malaria_rdt\"       \"fever\"            \n[16] \"rash\"              \"cough\"             \"red_eye\"          \n[19] \"pneumonia\"         \"encephalitis\"      \"muac\"             \n[22] \"vacc_status\"       \"vacc_doses\"        \"outcome\"          \n[25] \"date_outcome\"     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nTemporary objects, like the tmp dataframe you just created are just that: temporary. They are usually used to test if something has worked and designed to be overwritten each time you need to test something else. As such, you should not use these temporary objects as the input for other parts of your code. If you want to make a dataframe that will be reused, such as a clean version of df_raw, this should be done using an object with a proper name like df or df_clean.\n\n\n\n\nChanging and Adding Columns\nSo now we know how to selct and rename columns, but how do we modify them? This is where mutate() comes into play. This function can be used both to add new columns and to change existing ones.\nLet’s start with the basic mutate() syntax needed to add a new column:\n\n# DO NOT RUN (PSEUDO-CODE)\nmutate(df,\n       new_column = action(existing_column),\n       another_new_column = another_action(another_existing_column))\n\nIn the above code, we are creating a new column (new_column) by performing some sort of action (action()) on an existing column in the dataframe (existing_column). This action could be anything, it could use a function or be a simple arithmetic operation and can use one or more columns. For example, if we wanted to create a new column expressing MUAC in cm we could use the following:\n\nmutate(df_raw,\n       muac_cm = muac / 100)\n\n\nUse mutate() to create a new column called age_years that expresses age in years rather than months. The head of your new age_years column should look like this:\n\n\n   age_years\n1  3.0000000\n2  0.4166667\n3 13.0000000\n4  0.6666667\n5  0.5833333\n6  0.3333333\n\n\n\nGreat! But what if instead of creating a new column we instead wanted to change an existing one? Easy, you use need to use the existing column name on the left side of the = instead of giving a new column name. For example, in the above MUAC code we would write:\n\nmutate(df_raw,\n       muac = muac / 100)\n\nWe might want to keep age in months as well as years, so we won’t reassign that column. But there are some other columns that could stand to be changed. There are a lot of reasons we might want to change a column, two of the most common ones are:\n\nThe format of a string needs changing\nThe data type of a column is incorrect\n\nOur dataset has both of these problems. For example, while it isn’t per se a problem that region and sub_prefecture are in all capitals, it also isn’t particularly nice. To fix this, we can use another function from the {tidyverse}, this time from a package called {stringr} to make these columns title case:\n\nmutate(df_raw,\n       region = str_to_title(region),\n       sub_prefecture = str_to_title(sub_prefecture))\n\n\nUse mutate() to update the format of malaria_rdt and outcome to use title case. The head of these two columns should now look something like this:\n\n\n  malaria_rdt   outcome\n1    Negative Recovered\n2    Negative      &lt;NA&gt;\n3    Negative Recovered\n4    Negative Recovered\n5    Negative Recovered\n6    Negative Recovered\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNotice that we didn’t need to load {stringr} to do the above exercise. That’s because, like {dplyr} this package is loaded when we load the {tidyverse}.\n\n\nThat’s nicer. Now let’s consider the second issue, having variables with the wrong type.\n\nTake a look at the data type of your columns, do any of them look strange?  Hint. str() may be useful here.\n\nMost of the columns look ok, but it seems theres something strange with the dates. Some of them are character type and others are something called POSIXct. We would much rather have all of these columns use the simple Date type.\nTo convert to dates, we are going to call on yet another package from the the tidyverse, {lubridate}. In particular, we are going to use the function ymd(). For example:\n\nmutate(df_raw,\n       date_outcome = ymd(date_outcome))\n\n\nUse mutate() and ymd() to modify date_onset and date_admission to be Date type. Use a temporary dataframe tmp to check that your code is doing what you want it to.\n\n\n\nRemoving Duplicates\nOk great! We know how to select, rename, and modify our data. Another task we will often need to do is removing duplicate entries. Fortunately this one is easily done using the function distinct(), which has the following basic syntax:\n\n# DO NOT RUN (PSEUDO-CODE)\ndistinct(df)\n\nNotice that distinct only needs one argument by default, the dataset itself. This will look for and remove any duplicate observations in the dataframe. There are some fancier ways of using distinct() that will look for duplication on certain variables only, but that’s outside of the scope of today’s session.\n\nUse distinct() to create a temporary dataframe, tmp, that contains all the unique observations in df_raw. Compare the number of rows in tmp to that of df_raw. Did we have any duplicates?"

    "section": "The Pipe Operator",
    "text": "The Pipe Operator\nHold on, have we just sneakily learned how to do a lot of basic data cleaning? I sure think so! We should probably try to put some of the above steps together to start building a basic data cleaning pipeline. So far we haven’t been saving any of our changes, except perhaps to a temporary dataframe. It would be nice to keep them in a new clean df object.\nFor example, if we want to effect the column renaming we did above to a reusable object we might write something like this:\n\ndf &lt;- rename(df_raw, \n             prefecture = sub_prefecture,\n             village = village_commune,\n             facility = health_facility_name)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIn general, it’s good practice to keep a raw version of your dataset, here df_raw, that remains unmodified in your code. This is so that you always have it available in your environment as a reference and is always available at the start of your cleaning pipeline to improve reproducibility.\n\n\nNow we have a new object, df that we can do more operations on. Brilliant. For example, if we now wanted to select everything except for full_name we could update the above code like this:\n\n# Step 1: Rename Variables\ndf &lt;- rename(df_raw, \n             prefecture = sub_prefecture,\n             village = village_commune,\n             facility = health_facility_name)\n\n# Step 2: Select Variables to Keep\ndf &lt;- select(df,\n             -full_name)\n\nNotice that in this second step we are using df as the input of select() rather than df_raw because we want to continue working on our modified version of the data. Let’s say now we want to add a column of age in years:\n\n# Step 1: Rename Variables\ndf &lt;- rename(df_raw, \n             prefecture = sub_prefecture,\n             village = village_commune,\n             facility = health_facility_name)\n\n# Step 2: Select Variables to Keep\ndf &lt;- select(df,\n             -full_name)\n\n# Step 3: Add Age in Years\ndf &lt;- mutate(df,\n             age_years = age / 12)\n\nHm, ok well this is working but it is starting to get repetitive. With each step we are reusing the output of the last step and then updating the same dataframe, df. It would be better if these actions could be chained together in a simpler way.\nThis is exactly what the pipe operator, |&gt; is for! The pipe has the following basic syntax:\n\n# DO NOT RUN (PSEUDO-CODE)\ninput |&gt; action()\n\nHere the input on the left side (input) is “piped into” the action on the right side (action()). So for example instead of writing:\n\nselect(df_raw, id, sex)\n\nWe could instead write:\n\ndf_raw |&gt;\n  select(id, sex)\n\n\nTry out the above code to see if it works.\n\nThis can be used to chain multiple actions together and you will often see tidyverse style code that uses pipes in the following way:\n\n# DO NOT RUN (PSEUDO-CODE)\ndf &lt;- df_raw |&gt;\n  first_action() |&gt;\n  second_action() |&gt;\n  third_action()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nNotice that here each action in the pipe is given it’s own line. This is considered good practice as it makes your code easier to read and understand.\n\n\nSo, if we wanted to chain the example actions we saw above into a single pipe, we might write something like this:\n\ndf &lt;- df_raw |&gt;\n  rename(prefecture = sub_prefecture,\n         village = village_commune,\n         facility = health_facility_name) |&gt;\n  select(-full_name) |&gt;\n  mutate(age_years = age / 12)\n\nThat’s a lot easier than reassigning df after each step!\n\nLet’s see if we can put together what we learned above into a single pipeline! Use the pipe operator |&gt;, select(), rename(), mutate(), str_to_title(), ymd(), and distinct() to perform the following actions on df_raw and assign the output to a new dataframe called df:\n\nRemove the variables full_name and age_unit\nRename the following variables:\n\nage becomes age_months\nsub_prefecture becomes prefecture\nvillage_commune becomes village\nhealth_facility_name becomes facility\n\nAdd a variable age_years with patient age in years\nUpdate region and prefecture to use title case\nUpdate all date columns to use Date type\nRemove any duplicate observations\n\nThe head of your final data should look something like this:\n\n\n  id   sex age_months  region prefecture        village date_onset\n1  1 femme         36 Mandoul   Moissala Sangana Koïtan 2022-08-13\n2  2     f          5 Mandoul   Moissala      Mousdan 1 2022-08-18\n3  3     f        156 Mandoul   Moissala     Djaroua Ii 2022-08-17\n4  6 homme          8 Mandoul   Moissala     Monakoumba 2022-08-22\n5  7     m          7 Mandoul   Moissala      Tétindaya 2022-08-30\n6 10     m          4 Mandoul   Moissala      Danamadja 2022-08-30\n  date_consultation hospitalisation date_admission\n1        2022-08-14             yes     2022-08-14\n2        2022-08-25             yes     2022-08-25\n3        2022-08-20            &lt;NA&gt;           &lt;NA&gt;\n4        2022-08-25              no           &lt;NA&gt;\n5        2022-09-02              no           &lt;NA&gt;\n6        2022-09-02             yes     2022-09-02\n                         facility malaria_rdt fever rash cough red_eye\n1 Hôpital du District de Moissala    negative    No &lt;NA&gt;   Yes      No\n2 Hôpital du District de Moissala    negative    No   No   Yes      No\n3                      CS Silambi    negative   Yes &lt;NA&gt;    No      No\n4 Hôpital du District de Moissala    negative    No   No    No    &lt;NA&gt;\n5                      CS Silambi    negative  &lt;NA&gt;   No   Yes     Yes\n6                    Moissala Est    negative   Yes   No    No    &lt;NA&gt;\n  pneumonia encephalitis muac vacc_status vacc_doses   outcome date_outcome\n1        No           No  244        &lt;NA&gt;       &lt;NA&gt; recovered   2022-08-18\n2      &lt;NA&gt;           No  232          No       &lt;NA&gt;      &lt;NA&gt;   2022-08-28\n3        No         &lt;NA&gt;  123  Yes - oral       &lt;NA&gt; recovered         &lt;NA&gt;\n4        No           No  210          No       &lt;NA&gt; recovered         &lt;NA&gt;\n5        No           No   80          No       &lt;NA&gt; recovered         &lt;NA&gt;\n6        No           No  220          No       &lt;NA&gt; recovered   2022-09-03\n   age_years\n1  3.0000000\n2  0.4166667\n3 13.0000000\n4  0.6666667\n5  0.5833333\n6  0.3333333\n\n\nHint.

You will typically see it at the beginning of a session with instructions about the setup for that lesson.\n Example: Open a blank new script and name it my_first_script.R.\n\n\nThis is a code block, it indicates a coding exercise where you will actually write your own code.\n Example: Create an object called region that contains the value \"Mandoul\".\n\n\nThis is an observation block, it will have instructions about something that you are expected to look at or investigate.\n Example: Inspect the RStudio interface.\n\nAs you move through these exercises, you may run into some errors, which occur when R is unable to complete a command. This can happen for many reasons: maybe you misspelled the name of an object, asked R to look for a file that doesn’t exist, or provided the wrong type of data to a function. Whenever an error occurs, R will stop any ongoing calculation and give you a message explaining what went wrong. Having errors is completely normal and happens to all programmers, novice and expert. Much like a natural language, R is something you will get better at the more you practice and work through your mistakes."

    "section": "RStudio and R",
    "text": "RStudio and R\nR is a functional programming language that can be used to clean and manipulate data, run analyses (especially statistical ones), visualize results, and much more.\nRStudio is a piece of software that provides a user-friendly interface for R (also called an IDE, for Integrated Development Environment). While using a graphical interface isn’t required, it is strongly recommended for beginners.\n\nGetting Started with RStudio\nLet’s get started!\n\nOpen RStudio using the start menu or desktop shortcut; if RStudio is already open, please close it and open it again.\n\nYou should see an interface that looks something like this:\n\n\n\nView of the Rstudio IDE interface at opening\n\n\n\nInspect the RStudio interface.\n\nYou will have either three or four panels, including:\n\nUpper Right Corner\nTo the upper right there will be a panel with several tabs. Many of these are beyond the scope of this course, but we will use the following two tabs during the course:\n\nEnvironment. A list of the objects saved by the user in the current session. Because you’ve just started a new session, your environment should be empty.\nHistory. A record of all the commands you have executed during the current session.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can think of an R session like you would think of starting up a computer. Whenever a session starts, everything is blank and ready for computation in the same way that there aren’t any programs open when you first turn on your computer. In general, we encourage you to stop and start your R sessions regularly, you may just find that turning it off an on again will fix some of your bugs.\n\n\n\n\nBottom Right Corner\nTo the bottom right there will be another multi tab panel, including:\n\nFiles. A file explorer for the working directory, which is the folder location where R is currently working.\nPlots. A location where RStudio will display static visualizations; this tab should be empty for the moment.\nPackages. A list of all the R packages installed on your computer. Packages are collections of functions that help extend the functionality of R, and we will discuss them in greater detail in the next lesson.\nHelp. A place to read help pages and documentation for functions and packages.\nViewer. A location where RStudio will display html outputs such as tables, interactive widgets, or even full on dashboards.\n\n\n\nLeft Side\n\nTo the left (or bottom left if you have four panels) you should see the console, where R itself is run.\nTo the top left (if you have four panels) will be any open scripts.\n\nIn the next two sections, let’s talk about the console and scripts in more detail.\n\n\n\nThe Console\nThe console is where R itself is run.\nWhenever you open a new session, R will start by printing a bit of information about your set up, such as your R version number. Below this there should be a line containing the &gt; symbol and a blinking cursor. To run a command in R, you simply need to type it in after this &gt; and press Enter. R will then process your code and print the result (if there is one). A new &gt; line will then appear ready for the next command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIf the last line shown in the console starts with a + instead of a &gt; that means the console is not ready for a new command either because it is still processing a previous one or because it received a bit of incomplete code. If at any point you would like to cancel an ongoing or incomplete command, press Esc.\n\n\n\nRun the following commands in the console one line at a time and observe the output.\n\n5 + 90\n\n6 * 171\n\n189 / 36.6\n\n92^3\n\n(12 + 9)^4 / 1000\n\nNow, run the following command. Note that the final ) is missing, making the command incomplete. What happens when you do this?\n\n3 / (2 + 97\n\n\nYou may have noticed in the above examples that our code includes a lot of spaces between characters. This is not by accident. It is considered best practice to include spaces around most operators, such as +, -, *, /, &lt;, &gt;, =, and &lt;-. Not only do these spaces make your code easier for other people to read and understand, in some (rare) cases they may even be necessary to avoid errors. That said, do be aware that there are a small number of operators that should not be surrounded by spaces, such as ^, . and :.\n\n1+29+4.8/3*3           # BAD\n1 + 29 + 4.8 / 3 * 3   # GOOD\n\n1 ^ 2 # BAD\n1^2   # GOOD\n\nWe can also run functions in the console. We will discuss functions in more depth later in this lesson, but meanwhile know that the idea of functions in R is very similar to the one in Excel, where you no doubt are familiar with functions such as SUM or MEAN.\n\nRun the following commands in the console (one line at a time).\n\n# Find the minimum value\nmin(5, 10)\nmin(1, 8, 56, 0.3)\n\n# Find the maximum value\nmax(568, 258, 314)\n\n\n\n\nScripts\nScripts are text files that contain a series of commands for a particular programming language. The extension of the file indicates which language the commands were written in, and we will be using .R. Scripts allow us to create code that can be reused, shared, and even automated.\n\nWriting Your First Script\n\n\n\nSteps to create a new script in the RStudio IDE\n\n\nTo create a new script, follow the menu File &gt; New File &gt; R Script. Alternatively, you can click on the small green + sign just below the File menu or use the keyboard shortcut CTRL+SHIFT+N. This new and unsaved script will appear as a blank document in the top left panel.\nTo save your script, either use the menu File &gt; Save As or the keyboard shortcut CTRL+S.\n\nCreate and save a new script called discovery.R. Don’t forget to include the .R extension. For now, you can save it on your Desktop or any convenient location, but we will talk more about organizing your scripts in the next session.\n\n\n\nExecuting Code from a Script\nTo run code from a script simply place your cursor on the line you wish to run (or select multiple lines) and do one of the following:\n\nClick the Run icon at the top right of the script panel\nUse the shortcut CTRL+Enter (cursor will move to the next line afterwards)\nUse the shortcut ALT+Enter (cursor will stay on the current line afterwards)\n\n\nCopy the code you ran in the previous exercises into your script and run it using each of the above methods.\nFrom now on, you will write your code in your script and execute it from there, unless told otherwise in the instructions.\n\n\n\nComments\nIn R, any text prefaced by a # (until the end of a line) is called a comment. R does not consider comments to be code and will ignore them whenever you run your scripts. This makes comments an excellent way to document your code.\n\n# This is a comment\n\n2 + 3  # This is also a comment\n\nIt is helpful to future you and others to start your scripts with a few commented lines providing some information about the file.\n\n#### IMPORT & PREPARE DATA ####\n# Author :  Mathilde Mousset\n# Creation Date : 23/11/2024\n# Last Update : 30/11/2024\n# Description : Import and clean measles surveillance data from Moissala\n\n\nAdd some comments to the top of your script describing it.\n\nComments are also a handy way to split longer scripts into thematic sections, such as “Data Importation”, “Analysis”, “Visualization”, etc. For example:\n\n# NAME OF SECTION 1 -----------------------------------------------             \n\n# NAME OF SECTION 2 -----------------------------------------------             \n\n\nUse comments to create sections in your script that correspond to the main sections in this tutorial.\n\nFinally, comments allow us write helpful notes for our colleagues (and our future selves) that can help them understand the code and why we wrote it the way we did. The general guidance is to focus on comments that explain the “why” rather than the “what”. This is because the “what” of well written code should be relatively self explanatory.\nThis comment, for example, is completely superfluous:\n\n1 + 3  # Code to add one to three\n\nBy comparison, here are a few use cases that would warrant comments:\n\nYou define a constant, say a seroprevalence threshold value. You may want to add a comment providing the reference for where the value comes from.\nYour code contains a value or file name that needs to be updated every week. You should indicate this with a comment to ensure that anyone else using the code is aware.\nYou use a rare command or package that your colleague may not know or may find counter intuitive. You can use a comment to explain the rational behind that decision.\n\nThat being said, you are learning, and the scripts you are writing during this course are your notes, so feel free to us as many comments (of the “what” and “why” sort) as you need. You will naturally write less comments in the future, when some of the things that seem alien now become natural.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can comment a selected line with the shortcut CTRL+SHIFT+C.\nYou can add a first level section with CTRL+SHIFT+R.\n\n\n\nAdd some comments to describe the code that you’ve written thus far in your script."

    "text": "Data Types\nR has several different data types. The ones we will see most often in this course include:\n\nnumeric\nstring (text)\nboolean (TRUE / FALSE)\ndate\nfactor\n\n\nNumerics\nThe numeric type includes both integers and doubles (numbers that include a decimal) and can be created by simply writing the “naked” value into your script or console.\n\n\nStrings\nStrings are the R version of text and can be created by surrounding text with single or double quotation marks, for example \"district\" or 'cases' (double quotations are typically considered best practice).\n\nCompare the output in the console for the following commands:\n\n28         # numeric\n\"28\"       # text\n28 + \"28\"  # produces an error\n\n\nThe last command above will give an error because we cannot perform arithmetic operations that combine text and numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nR is case sensitive, meaning that the string \"ABC\" is not the same as \"abc\".\n\n\n\nIf you would like to create a string that contains a quotation mark the best practice is to escape the character by putting a \\ in front of it, ie: \"She said \\\"Hello\\\" then left\" or 'it\\'s a beautiful day'. Equivalently, if you used a double quotation to create the string you can use single quotes inside of it freely (ie: \"it's a beautiful day\") and vice versa (i.e.: 'She said \"Hello\" then left').\n\n\n\nBoolean (Logical)\nThe boolean (or “logical”) type stores true/false values and is created by writing either TRUE or FALSE without quotation marks.\nInternally, R thinks of TRUE and FALSE as being a special version of 1 and 0 respectively, and boolean values can be easily translated to these numeric equivalents for arithmetic operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou may find people using T or F but this is discouraged as T and F can also be used as object or variable names. TRUE and FALSE, however, are protected in R, meaning they cannot be reassigned to another value.\n\n\n\n\nDetermining the Type of an Object\nThere are several functions to determine the type of an object (often called the class of the object in R).\n\nType the following commands in your script and run them:\n\n# Get the Type of an Object\nclass(28)  \nclass(\"Mandoul\")\n\n# Test the Type of an Object\nis.numeric(28)\nis.numeric(\"Mandoul\")\nis.character(\"Mandoul\")\n\nis.numeric(TRUE)\nis.character(TRUE)\nis.logical(FALSE)"

    "section": "Creating an Object",
    "text": "Creating an Object\nIn R, pretty much everything is an object, including functions, scalar values, and other more complex data structures. Before introducing these structures, let’s take an important detour to discuss how objects are saved into your environment.\nOften, we will want to reuse the same values or data throughout a script and it is therefore very useful to store them as objects in our environment. To do this we use the assignment operator, &lt;-.\n\nLook at the environment panel on the top right, verifying that it is empty, then type the following command in your script and run it to save a variable called cases into your environment.\n\ncases &lt;- 28\n\nLook at the environment again. Is it still empty?\n\nIf you’d like to access the value of your new object, cases, you simply need to execute its name.\n\ncases\n\n[1] 28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe reason we need to wrap strings in quotation marks is actually to allow R to differentiate between strings (\"cases\" and object names cases).\n\n\nOnce created, objects can be used in other commands:\n\ncases + 5\n\n[1] 33\n\n\n\nFrom your script, create an object called region that contains the value \"Mandoul\". Do you see it in your environment?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nDon’t forget that we should always surround &lt;- with spaces to improve readability and avoid errors.\n\nx&lt;-3     # BAD\nx &lt;- 3   # GOOD\n\n\n\n\nUpdating an Object\nWe often want to update the value stored in an object. To do this, we simply assign a new value with the same syntax we used to create it in the first place:\n\ncases &lt;- 32\n\n\nUpdate the value of region to \"Moyen Chari\".\n\n\n\nObject Names\nWhen naming your objects, there are a few (relatively) hard rules:\n\nDon’t start with a number\nDon’t use spaces (use a _ instead)\nDon’t use protected values (like TRUE and FALSE) or function names (like mean)\nDon’t use capital letters\n\nBeyond these hard rules, there are also more subjective best practices and personal styles. In general aim for names that are short and descriptive:\n\na &lt;- 19                             # BAD (not informative)\nage_du_patient_a_l_admission &lt;- 19  # BAD (too long)\nage &lt;- 19                           # GOOD\n\nGiving your objects clear and informative names helps to make your code readable, making it easy for others to understand without the need for checking the data dictionary every two seconds."

    "section": "Data Structures",
    "text": "Data Structures\nUp until now we have looked only at simple objects that store single values, let’s now turn our focus to more complex structures that can store entire datasets.\n\nVectors\nWe can collect multiple values (such as numerics or strings) into a single object, called a vector.\nTechnically, there are several types of vectors, for example:\n\nSimple vectors (or atomic vectors) can only contain one type of values. For example, a numeric vector 2, 4, 6 or a string vector \"Mandoul\", \"Moyen Chari\".\nRecursive vectors (usually called lists) are far more complex and can contain multiple dimensions and types of data. We will not learn about them in this lesson.\n\nThis course will not go into detail on the more abstract concepts behind these structures and instead focus only on those you will encounter most often in your daily work.\n\nSimple Vectors\nSimple vectors can contain one or more values of a single data type, they thus have two key properties: length and type. For the purpose of this class, we will use the terms “simple vector” and “vector” interchangeably (as is typical in the R community).\nYou’ve technically already created your first simple vector when you built cases and region. These were simply vectors with a length of one. To create a vector with more than one value, we will use the function c() (mnemonic):\n\ncases &lt;- c(2, 5, 8, 0, 4)\n\n\nUpdate cases with the above values and update region to create a string vector containing the values: Mandoul, Moyen-Chari, Logone Oriental, Tibesti, and Logone Occidental.\n\nWe can now use functions on the objects we have created:\n\nmean(cases)      # calculate the mean value of the cases vector\n\n[1] 3.8\n\ntoupper(region)  # convert all the values in region to upper case\n\n[1] \"MANDOUL\"           \"MOYEN-CHARI\"       \"LOGONE ORIENTAL\"  \n[4] \"TIBESTI\"           \"LOGONE OCCIDENTAL\"\n\n\n\nLet’s use some functions! Try to write code that does the following:\n\nCalculate the sum of cases using the function sum()\nConvert the text in region to lowercase using the function tolower()\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessing the Values of a Vector\nIt is possible to access the value of a vector using square brackets containing the index (position) of the desired value, ie: [3] or [189].\n\ncases[2]   # 2nd value of cases\n\n[1] 5\n\ncases[10]  # 10th value of cases\n\n[1] NA\n\n\nOoops it does not exist! We will come back to what this NA means in the Missing Values section.\nWe can also access a range of values, just as we might do in Excel. To create a range we use the : operator to separate the desired minimum and maximum index:\n\ncases[2:4]  # 2nd to 4th values of cases\n\n[1] 5 8 0\n\n\n\nGet the 3rd value of region.\nWrite code to access the values “Mandoul” and “Moyen-Chari” in the vector region.\n\n\n\nData frames\nData frames are tabular structures / 2D tables with rows and columns. It is very similar to a “table” structure in Excel. As epidemiologists, this type of data structure is perhaps the most useful and you will likely use them on a daily basis, to store linelist data for example.\n\nCreating a data frame\nWe can create a data frame using the function data.frame():\n\ndata.frame(col1 = c(1, 4, 2, 9),\n           col2 = c(\"a bit of text\", \"some more text\", \"hello\", \"epidemiologists!\"))\n\n  col1             col2\n1    1    a bit of text\n2    4   some more text\n3    2            hello\n4    9 epidemiologists!\n\n\nSee how col1 was created from a numeric vector, and col2 from a vector of strings. Here we chose the names of the columns (col1 and col2), which is the normal way, but you can run the code without to see how R handles names by default.\n\nIn your script, create a data frame called data_cases that contains cases in one column and region in the other.\n\n\n\nExploring a data frame\ndata_cases should now appear in your environment. You can click on the blue circle with a white triangle in to see some additional information, or click on its name to open the object in the same pane as the scripts to view it.\n\n\n\nThe data_case data frame now appears in the Environment pane\n\n\nThere are several handy functions we can use to explore a data frame:\n\nRun the following commands and try to determine what type of information they are returning.\n\nstr(data_cases)     # STRucture of the object\ndim(data_cases)     # DIMension of the object\nnrow(data_cases)    # Number of ROWs\nncol(data_cases)    # Number of COLumns\nnames(data_cases)   # column NAMES\n\n\nLet’s practice a bit more! R comes with several built in data sets that can be accessed directly, including one called iris. It is convenient today as we have not learned to import data in R yet (don’t worry, we will work on linelist data from the second session then onwards).\nWe can see the first few lines of this data frame using the function head():\n\nhead(iris)\n\n  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species\n1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa\n2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa\n3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa\n4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa\n5          5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa\n6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa\n\n\n\nHow many rows and columns are there in iris? What are the names of its columns?\n\n\n\nAccessing Data in a data frame\nIn R, there are several methods for accessing the rows and/or columns of a data frame. In this introductory session we will focus on the [ ] syntax.\nWe use square brackets to access single values or ranges within our data frame. To do this we must give R both a row number (or range of rows) and column number/name (or range of columns), using the syntax [row, column].\n\ndata_cases[1, 2]          # the value of row one, column 2\n\n[1] \"Mandoul\"\n\ndata_cases[1, \"region\"]   # first value in the region column\n\n[1] \"Mandoul\"\n\n\nIf we want to access all of the rows (or columns) we can simple leave a space in the place of the number/name:\n\ndata_cases[1, ]           # values of all columns in row one\n\n  cases  region\n1     2 Mandoul\n\ndata_cases[2:4, ]         # values of all columns for rows 2 through 4\n\n  cases         region\n2     5       Sud Kivu\n3     8 Kasai oriental\n4     0          Kasai\n\ndata_cases[ , \"region\"]   # values of all rows for the region column\n\n[1] \"Mandoul\"        \"Sud Kivu\"       \"Kasai oriental\" \"Kasai\"         \n[5] \"Haut Katanga\"  \n\n\nWe can even select multiple non-consecutive indices by using a numeric vector:\n\ndata_cases[c(1, 3), ]  # lines 1 and 3 (all columns)\n\n  cases         region\n1     2        Mandoul\n3     8 Kasai oriental\n\n\nDo be careful, as the type of output returned when extracting data from a data frame can sometimes depend on the style of indexing used:\n\nstr(data_cases[1 , ])   # returns a data frame\n\n'data.frame':   1 obs. of  2 variables:\n $ cases : num 2\n $ region: chr \"Mandoul\"\n\nstr(data_cases[ , 1])   # returns a simple vector\n\n num [1:5] 2 5 8 0 4\n\n\nAnother syntaxt to extract the various columns of a data frame:\n\ndata_cases[2]           # returns the second column (as a data frame)\n\n          region\n1        Mandoul\n2       Sud Kivu\n3 Kasai oriental\n4          Kasai\n5   Haut Katanga\n\ndata_cases[\"region\"]    # returns the region column (as a data frame)\n\n          region\n1        Mandoul\n2       Sud Kivu\n3 Kasai oriental\n4          Kasai\n5   Haut Katanga\n\n\nNotice that these commands returned single-column data frames.\n\nWrite some code to:\n\nextract the third value in the region column of your data frame\n\nextract the second and third values of the cases column\n\ncalculate the sum of the cases column of your data frame"

NA is somewhat unique in R as it doesn’t per se have a fixed type, rather, it will take on the type of the values around it. For example, an NA in a numeric column will then take on the numeric type. We will discuss the idea of missing data in more depth in later sessions of the course."

    "section": "Functions",
    "text": "Functions\nFunctions are objects that contain commands (instead of values) that are run whenever the function is called. You are without doubt familiar with functions in Excel such as SUM or MEAN and the idea of functions in R is exactly the same.\nMost functions require some sort of input, such as a dataset or parameter. These inputs are called arguments and are normally named. For example, when we ran sum(cases), we provided the vector cases as the first (and only) argument to the function sum().\nOften, a function will have a combination of both required and optional arguments. The first argument of a function is almost always required and is typically a dataset. As an obligatory and rather obvious argument, most people omit its name when calling a function; ie: i.e. people will write mean(cases) instead of mean(x = cases). Optional arguments on the other hand are usually added using their name, i.e.: mean(x = cases, na.rm = TRUE).\nOptional arguments typically have default values and we only include them when we want to change their defaults (and thus change the default behavior of the function). For example, the na.rm argument of mean() determines whether R will ignore missing values when calculating a mean. The default state of the na.rm argument is FALSE, so by default, the mean performed on data with missing values will always return NA as the result:\n\nmean(c(1, 3, NA))\n\n[1] NA\n\n\nThis is true for many arithmetic operations in R. If we want R to calculate the mean on whatever data is available (and ignore the missing values) we need to explicitly set na.rm = TRUE:\n\nmean(c(1, 3, NA), na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nNotice that arguments are separated by commas. These commas should always be followed by a space and whenever a named argument is used the = should be surrounded by spaces:\n\nmean(cases,na.rm=TRUE)     # BAD\nmean(cases, na.rm = TRUE)  # GOOD\n\nAs you work with increasingly complex functions, you may start to have a lot of arguments. For readability, it is typically recommended to split each argument onto its own line:\n\nmean(cases, \n     na.rm = TRUE) \n\n\n\nWhat happens if we put the arguments in the wrong order? If you provided the name of the arguments in you command, the function will still work exactly as expected. That being said, doing this would make your code harder to read and we encourage you to stick with a standard order of putting obligatory arguments like data first.\n\n# technically functional but hard to read:\nmean(na.rm = TRUE,  \n     x = cases) \n\n# better:\nmean(cases,         \n     na.rm = TRUE)\n\nOf course, if you mess up the ordering of arguments and didn’t include their names your code will not work as expected, or even throw an error:\n\nmean(TRUE, cases)   # not what you expect"

    "text": "Mise en place du projet\n\nStructure des dossiers\n\nSi ce n’est pas déjà fait, téléchargez le dossier du cours décompressez-le. Sauvegardez le dossier non compressé à un endroit non connecté à OneDrive et ouvrez-le.\n\n\n\n  Dossier du cours\n\n\n\n\nCe dossier illustre une structure typique et recommandée pour vos projets de code :\n\n📁 data\n\n📁 raw\n📁 clean\n\n📁 R\n📁 outputs\n\nCe dossier sera votre répertoire de travail pour toutes les sessions de ce cours. Vous y créerez un projet RStudio (explications ci-dessous), et y enregistrerez tous vos scripts (sous dossier R). Les données brutes se trouvent déjà dans data/raw.\n\n\nDéfinitions\nVoici deux concepts importants que nous allons rencontrer dans cette session :\nRépertoire de travail. Le répertoire de travail est l’emplacement (dossier) où votre session R en cours travaille. Si vous enregistrez un fichier, par exemple, il sera enregistré dans ce dossier par défaut. De même, Si vous ouvrez un fichier, ce dossier sera affiché par défaut. Tous les chemins relatifs auront ce dossier pour origine. Par défaut, R choisit généralement votre dossier “Documents” comme répertoire de travail sur les machines Windows.\nRacine. La racine fait référence au niveau de dossier le plus élevé du répertoire de travail. Si le dossier de votre cours s’appelle FETCHR la racine se trouverait directement à l’intérieur de celui-ci (et non dans l’un de ses sous-dossiers comme R ou data).\n\n\nProjets RStudio\nUn projet RStudio est outil qui va faciliter votre vie et aider RStudio à trouver les différents fichiers.\nPour rappel, votre interface doit ressembler à ceci :\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Capture d’écran d’une interface RStudio typique\n\n\n\n\nOuvrez RStudio et suivez ces étapes pour créer un nouveau projet :\n\ncliquez sur File &gt; New Project &gt; Existing Directory &gt; Browse,\nnaviguez jusqu’au dossier du cours (en l’ouvrant)\ncliquez sur Create Project.\n\n\n\nDans l’explorateur Windows, examinez le dossier du cours. Vous devriez maintenant voir un nouveau fichier avec l’extension .Rproj qui a une petite icône bleue avec un R au milieu\n\n\n\n\nIcône associée aux projets RStudio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSi vous ne voyez pas ce fichier, c’est probablement parce qu’il est caché par défaut sur votre ordinateur. Pour modifier ce paramètre dans l’explorateur Windows, allez dans le menu Afficher et sélectionnez Extensions de noms de fichier.\n\n\nLorsque vous ouvrez un projet RStudio, RStudio démarre une nouvelle session R spécifique à ce projet, ouvre les fichiers associés et définit la racine de votre dossier comme répertoire de travail. Une conséquence immédiate est que le panneau Files en bas à droite de l’interface montre les sous dossiers présents dans le répertoire de travail, i.e. votre dossier de cours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIl est fortement recommandé de mettre en place un projet RStudio distinct pour chacune de vos analyses afin de garantir que les fichiers de vos projets restent organisés.\n\n\nIl existe plusieurs façons d’ouvrir un projet RStudio :\n\nUtilisez le menu RStudio File &gt; Open Project puis sélectionnez le fichier .Rproj approprié\nCliquez sur le bouton Project: (none) en haut à droite de l’interface RStudio\nNaviguez dans l’explorateur de fichiers Windows jusqu’à votre dossier de cours et double-cliquez sur le fichier avec l’extension .Rproj\n\n\n\nLes options de RStudio\nAvant de poursuivre, allons modifier certaines des options de RStudio qui peuvent causer des problèmes.\n\nOuvrez les options globales (Tools &gt; Global Options) et ouvrez l’onglet General (menu de gauche). Déselectionnez toutes les cases des sections R Sessions, Workspace et History.\n\n\n\n\nCapture d’écran des options de RStudio\n\n\nLorsque ces options sont activées, RStudio enregistre les objets de votre environnement et les charge à chaque fois que vous ouvrez une nouvelle session R. Ca semble être une bonne idée, mais il est en fait préférable de toujours commencer votre travail à partir d’une session R vide afin d’éviter les erreurs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nN’oubliez pas que toutes les commandes nécessaires au nettoyage et à l’analyse de vos données doivent être enregistrées explicitement dans un script, dans le bon ordre. Faire retourner le script devrait arriver aux mêmes résultats que précédement.\n\n\n\n\nCréation d’un nouveau script\n\nOuvrez un nouveau script et enregistrez-le dans le sous-dossier R de votre projet sous le nom import_data.R.\nAjoutez des métadonnées au début du script, comme recommandé lors première session, en utilisant des commentaires. Veillez à inclure :\n\nLe titre\nL’auteur du script\nLa date de création\nUne description rapide de ce que fait le script\n\n\nNous sommes prêts à commencer à coder"

    "section": "Paquets",
    "text": "Paquets\nLes paquets [packages] sont des collections de fonctions qui étendent les fonctionalités de R. Vous en utiliserez un grand nombre pendant ce cours et dans votre travail quotidien. R étant open-souce, les packages sont téléchargeable et utilisable gratuitement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDans ce cours, nous utiliserons une convention commune qui est de référencer les paquets entre {}. Par exemple {ggplot2} est le nom du paquet ggplot2 qui contient des fonctions pour créer des graphes, telles que ggplot(), geom_point() etc…\n\n\n\nInstallation\nLa fonction install.packages() télécharge et installe un nouveau paquet sur votre ordinateur, dans la bibliothèque de paquets associée à R. Vous n’avez à faire cette opération qu’une seule fois par paquet et ordinateur.\n\ninstall.packages(\"here\") # installe le paquet {here} \n\nN’oubliez pas de mettre le nom du paquet entre guillemets lorsque vous utilisez la commande install.packages(). Que se passe-t-il si vous ne le faites pas ?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSi vous suivez cette session dans le cadre d’un cours, pour éviter tout problème potentiel de connectivité internet pendant la formation, nous vous avons déjà fait installer la plupart des paquets du cours.\nSi vous suivez ce tutoriel seul ou si vous n’avez pas encore installé les paquets, vous devrez installer manuellement chaque nouveau paquet que nous rencontrerons avec la fonction install.packages().\n\n\n\n\nUtilisation\nUne fois qu’un paquet est installé, il faut indiquer à R que nous souhaitons l’utiliser pour une session donnée en le chargeant dans la session avec la fonction library().\n\nlibrary(here) # charge le paquet {here} dans la session\n\n\nUtilisez la fonction library() pour charger les paquets here et rio qui seront utilisés aujourd’hui.\n\nIl se peut que vous obteniez parfois un message d’avertissement signalant que certaines fonctions ont été masquées ou que la version actuelle du paquet a été construite pour une version différente de R. Ces messages ne doivent pas vous inquiéter, mais il faut les lire et essayer de comprendre ce qui se passe.\n\nExécutez le code suivant. Comprenez-vous le message d’erreur ?\n\nlibrary(ggplot)\n\n\nLe code ci-dessus génère une erreur car il y a une faute de frappe dans le nom du paquet, et vous avez donc essayé de charger un paquet qui n’existe pas. Rappelez-vous que R est pénible, et en particulier est sensible à la casse : beaucoup de vos erreurs viendront de petites fautes dans les noms de fonctions ou d’objets. Ici, par exemple, nous voulions charger le paquet ggplot2 mais nous avons écrit ggplot à la place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIl est recommandé d’avoir une section au début de votre script qui charge tous les paquets dont vous aurez besoin dans votre script en un seul endroit :\n\n# Packages ----------------------------\nlibrary(tidyverse)   # manipulation de données\nlibrary(lubridate)   # manipulation des dates\n\nCelà permet de savoir rapidement quels paquets doivent être installés pour exécuter un script.\n\n\n\nCréez une section “Paquets” dans votre script à l’aide de commentaires\n\n\n\nMettre à jour les paquets\nR dispose d’une communauté de développeurs très active et il est assez courant que les paquets soient mis à jour, avec de nouvelles fonctionalités ou des corrections de bugs. Pour mettre à jour les paquets de votre bibliothèque, rendez-vous dans l’onglet Packages du panneau inférieur droit et cliquez sur Update. N’oubliez pas que vous devez être connecté à internet pendant ce processus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nLa mise à jour de certains paquets peut parfois changer le comportement de certaines fonctions, ce qui peut casser votre code. Pas de panique. La meilleure pratique consiste à adapter votre code mais, dans le pire des cas, vous pouvez installer une ancienne version du paquet incriminé."

    "section": "Importation de données",
    "text": "Importation de données\n\nTrouver son chemin…\nPour ouvrir un fichier dans R, vous devez fournir un chemin d’accès au fichier. Un chemin d’accès est simplement un (long) nom pour un fichier qui inclut son emplacement sur votre ordinateur. Les chemins d’accès peuvent être absolus ou relatifs.\n\nChemins d’accès absolus\nLes chemins d’accès absolus sont spécifiques à votre ordinateur et vont jusqu’au niveau de votre disque dur. Par exemple : D:/OneDrive - MSF/Documents/monitoring/cholera/fancy_project/data/raw/example_linelist.xlsx. Il est clair que ce chemin ne fonctionne que sur un ordinateur particulier.\nL’utilisation de chemins absolus encodés en dur est fortement déconseillé car cela rend votre code fragile et augmente la maintenance : en effet, les chemins devront tous être mis à jour chaque fois quelqu’un d’autre exécute votre code, ou que le dossier du projet est déplacé sur votre ordinateur.\n\n\nChemins d’accès relatifs\nLes chemins relatifs sont définis par rapport à votre répertoire de travail. Comme l’emplacement du fichier .Rproj définit le répertoire de travail, les chemins sont relatifs à cette racine. Pour vous, un chemin relatif ressemblera à ça : data/raw/example_linelist.xlsx.\nCela signifie que tant que la structure interne du dossier contenant votre projet est préservée, le chemin d’accès relatif sera valable quelque soit l’ordinateur.\n\n\nChemins d’accès robustes avec la fonction here()\nLe paquet {here} dispose d’une fonction here() qui aide à créer des chemins d’accès. Elle présente deux avantages :\n\nElle détecte la présence d’un fichier .Rproj et est capable de construire un chemin absolu à partir d’un chemin relatif dans votre projet RStudio.\nElle choisit automatiquement le séparateur adapté à votre système d’exploitation : /, \\ ou //.\n\n\nlibrary(here)\nhere(\"data\", \"raw\", \"example_linelist.xlsx\")\n\n[1] \"/home/catherine/Documents/epicentre/training/repicentre/data/raw/example_linelist.xlsx\"\n\n\n\nlibrary(here)\nhere(\"data\", \"raw\", \"example_linelist.xlsx\")\n\n[1] \"/home/catherine/Documents/epicentre/training/repicentre/data/raw/example_linelist.xlsx\"\n\n\nVoyez comme nous n’avons défini que le chemin relatif et la fonction a reconstitué le chemin absolu. Celà marchera donc sur l’ordinateur d’un collègue, y compris sur un autre système d’exploitation, du moment que la structure du répertoire de travail est intacte.\nNous vous encourageons fortement à utiliser here() chaque fois que vous devez créer un chemin d’accès à un fichier.\n\nExécutez le code ci-dessus dans la console. Quel chemin d’accès here(\"data\", \"raw\") vous donne-t-il ?\n\n\nUtilisez here() pour créer le chemin vers le fichier Moissalla-rougeole-liste-lineaire-FR.xlsx.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nhere() crée une chaîne de caractères contenant l’adresse d’un fichier, mais ne vérifie pas si ce fichier existe réellement sur votre ordinateur. Si le fichier est absent ou s’il y a une faute de frappe dans votre code, vous obtiendrez une erreur lors de l’utilisation du chemin ainsi créé. Vous pouvez tester si un fichier existe à cette adresse avec la fonction file.exists().\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nOn veut souvent définir plusieurs chemins dans un projet (données brutes, données propres, où sauver les graphes etc.). C’est une bonne pratique que de créer une nouvelle section au début de votre script, après le chargement des paquets, pour définir et stocker les chemins d’accès dans des objets.\n\n\n\n\n\nImporter les données\nDans R, différents formats de fichiers sont importés par différentes fonctions spécialisées, ce qui est fastidieux à mémoriser et à charger. La fonction import() du paquet {rio} nous fait gagner du temps en reconnaissant l’extension des fichier et en appelent automatiquement une fonction spécialisée pour charger les données.\nComme import() ne fait qu’appeler d’autres fonctions en arrière-plan, il est possible qu’elle ait besoin d’arguments optionnels spécifiques pour certains types de fichier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nLa (longue) liste des types de fichiers pris en charge par {rio} est sur le site du paquet. Dans la suite de la leçon, nous nous concentrerons sur l’importation de données à partir de fichiers Excel .xlsx.\n\n\n\nImport de la première feuille\nAu minimum la fonction import() a besoin qu’on lui donne le chemin du fichier avec l’argument file :\n\nimport(file = here(\"data\", \"raw\", \"example_linelist.xlsx\"))\n\nNotez que nous avons imbriqué la commande here() à l’intérieur de la commande import(). L’imbrication de fonctions est autorisée et même courrante en R. R évalue les fonctions imbriquées de l’intérieur (here()) à l’extérieur (import()). La valeur renvoyée par here() est donc utilisée comme valeur d’entrée d’import().\n\nImportez le fichier Moissalla-rougeole-liste-lineaire-FR.xlsx en utilisant here() et import().\n\nSi votre importation a fonctionné correctement, R affichera les données dans la console mais ne les enregistrera pas dans l’environnement car nous ne les avons pas assignées à un objet.\n\nRéimportez vos données, mais cette fois-ci, sauvegardez-les dans un objet appelé df_linelist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nSi votre jeu de données est très gros, il vaut mieux éviter de l’afficher dans la console…\n\n\n\n\nImport d’une autre feuille\nComme vous venez de le voir, la fonction import() importe la première feuille d’un fichier Excel par défaut. Il est cependant possible de passer le numéro de la feuille ou son nom (en chaîne de caractères) à l’argument which :\n\nimport(file = here(\"data\", \"raw\", \"example_linelist.xlsx\"),  # chemin\n       which = 2)                                            # spécifie la deuxième feuille\n\nNotez que l’argument which est spécifique aux types de fichiers comportant plusieurs feuilles, tels que les fichiers Excel ou .Rdata. Si vous essayez de l’utiliser sur un fichier .csv l’argument sera ignoré."

Counting one variable is nice, but we often want to count the number observations based on two (or more!) variables.\nThese tables are called contingency tables. For example, knowing the number of patients by sub_prefecture is great but we might want to stratify by both sub_prefecture and age_group to see if certain areas have unusually old patients. Doing this is easy, you just need to pass multiple column names to count(); for example:\n\ndf_linelist |&gt;\n  count(sub_prefecture, age_group)\n\n\nCreate a new summary table counting the number of patients stratified by sub_prefecture and hospitalisation. What happens if you change the order of the arguments given to count()?\n\n\nUsing count() answer the following questions:\n\nHow many patients were female? What is the proportion?\nWhat are all the possible values of the outcome variable?\nHow many patients between 1 - 4 years have recovered?"

How can you also call the proportion of patients who died ? Are you happy with this calculation ?\n\nThe proportion of cases that died is also referred to as the Case Fatality Ratio (CFR). However, to precisely calculate the CFR we need to make sure that the denominator only includes patient for whom we are sure of their outcome (ie we need to remove all cases with NA or left aginst medical advice).\nRemember that we can do this using filter(). To filter for missing values (NA) in a variable we can use the small function is.na(outcome). Adding a ! in front will do the opposite: removing missing values from outcome:\n\ndf_linelist |&gt;\n  filter(\n    outcome != \"left against medical advice\", \n    !is.na(outcome)\n  ) |&gt;\n  count(outcome)\n\n\nWhich other conditionnal statement could you use in filter() to obtain the same results\n\nNow that we have removed the patients with unknown outcomes, we can add this before creating our frequency table to get the right CFR.\n\nUsing your filter, update your code to summarize the observed number of patients who survived and died as well as the CFR (proportion who died). Store this new dataframe into an object, cfr_df.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBonus. Another useful “shortcut” function is drop_na() from the package {tidyr} that equates to filter(!is.na()).\n\ndf_linelist |&gt;\n  drop_na(outcome) |&gt;\n  count(outcome)\n\ndrop_na() is particularly useful as you can give it multiple column names to filter by. But be careful that doing so will remove all rows where one or more of those columns have a missing value."

    "section": "Summary Table: Statistics by sub prefecture",
    "text": "Summary Table: Statistics by sub prefecture\nOk now that we have produced some simple frequency and contingency tables we may want to increase the complexity. A common task in epidemiology is to look at summary statistics within subsets of the data.\nFor example, we may be asked to produce patient statistics at the sub-prefecture level, ie: for each sub-prefecture in the data, we need to answer the following questions:\n\nHow many patients?\nWhat is their average age?\nWhat was the earliest date of admission?\nHow many patients have been hospitalised?\nAmong children under 6 months, how many have died?\n\nThis is exactly what the function summarize() has been made for! It allows us to calculate summary statistics on a dataset, and the syntax is similar to that of mutate():\n\n# DO NOT RUN (PSEUDO-CODE)\ndf |&gt;\n  mutate(new_col = function_to_create(existing_col))\n\ndf |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    .by = grouping_variable,\n    new_col = summary_function(existing_col)\n  )\n\nConsider the following code, here we are summarising the data to calculate the average age across all patients.\n\ndf_linelist |&gt;\n  summarize(mean_age = mean(age))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  mean_age\n     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     6.82\n\n\nYou might notice that this code yields a single value for average age. When the data are not grouped, summarize() will consider the full dataset as a single group and return one summary statistic for the whole dataset. To calculate the average age by a specific strata, we need to specify a “grouping variable” using the .by = argument:\n\ndf_linelist |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    .by = sex,\n    mean_age = mean(age)\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  sex   mean_age\n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 f         6.77\n2 m         6.87\n\n\n\nTake a look at the above results. How would you interpret them?\n\nNow that we can use summarize() we can use it to calculate some proper summary statistics by sub-prefecture. Let’s start by calling an empty summarize() and grouping the data on sub_prefecture.\n\nRun the following code:\n\ndf_linelist |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    .by = sub_prefecture\n  )\n\nWhat happens when you run these lines?\n\n\nCounts\nWe first want to look at the number of cases in each sub_prefecture. This can be done using the helper function n():\n\ndf_linelist |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    .by = sub_prefecture,\n    n_patients = n()\n  )\n\n\nOk now let’s build a summary table for each sub_prefecture. First start by replicating the above lines\n\n\n\nContinuous Summaries\nWe can then use the simple mean, median, min, max functions to produce summaries for continuous variables. For example the average age:\n\ndf_linelist |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    .by = sub_prefecture,\n    n_patients = n(),\n    mean_age = mean(age)\n  )\n\n\nAdd the minimum date of admission to your table for each of the sub_prefecture? Are you happy with the results?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nRemember that with the small functions (mean, median, min, max), you need to explicitly tell R to remove NA.\n\n\n\n\nCounting with a Condition\nWe may also be interested in looking at the number of patients (rows) that fit a condition: the number of patients that were female. Counting by a logical condition can be done with the following syntax:\n\n# DO NOT RUN (PSEUDO-CODE)\nsummarize(\n  sum_category = sum(LOGIC_TEST,\n  na.rm = TRUE\n))\n\nThis sum allows us to count all the lines where our condition was met. For example:\n\ndf_linelist |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    .by = sub_prefecture,\n    n_female = sum(sex == \"f\", na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\n\nAdd a variable to your table that counts the number of patients that have been hospitalised? (ie: rows that have yes in variable hospitalisation)\n\n\n\nOther Statistics\nSometimes we want to produce a statistic other than counting given a condition, let’s say the mean age of all hospitalised patients. Here the syntax is a bit different:\n\n# DO NOT RUN (PSEUDO-CODE)\ndf |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    mean_category = mean(col_to_use[LOGIC_TEST],\n    na.rm = TRUE\n  ))\n\nHere, we have:\n\nIndicated which column we want to use when caluclating the summary statistic (here a mean)\nIndexed that column using a logical test\n\nFor example to compute the mean() of the age variable but only in rows where hospitalisation == \"yes\" we would write it like this:\n\ndf_linelist |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    .by = sub_prefecture,\n    n_patients = n(),\n    mean_age_hosp = mean(age[hospitalisation == \"yes\"], na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\n\nCan you use this syntax to calculate the mean age of female patients in your table ?\n\nThat is looking great! We are starting to get a pretty exhaustive grouped summary table with a lot of useful information by sub_prefecture! An extra challenge for you:\n\nCHALLENGE: Could you add a variable to your table that counts the number of patients that died among the ones that are &lt; 6 months old.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou want to count rows (so use sum()) that fill a specific condition for outcome (outcome == \"dead\"), but only when age_group == \"&lt; 6 months\"\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the output\nFinally, a reminder that summarize() returns a dataframe that we can then further manipulate (eg: with filter and mutate).\n\nCan you add a mutate() after producing your summary table to calculate:\n\nThe proportion of hospitalised patients per sub-prefecture\nThe proportion of female patients per sub-prefecture\n\n\nHere is our final table !"

Son utilisation n’est pas obligatoire, mais très fortement recommandée pour les débutants.\n\nPremiers pas avec RStudio\n\nOuvrez RStudio en utilisant le menu de démarrage de votre ordinateur ou le raccourci créé par défaut sur le bureau ; si RStudio était déjà ouvert, fermez-le et ouvrez-le à nouveau.\n\nVous devriez voir une interface qui ressemble à ceci :\n\n\n\nVue de l’interface de l’IDE Rstudio à l’ouverture\n\n\n\nInspectez l’interface de RStudio.\n\nVous verrez trois ou quatre panneaux.\n\nPanneau supérieur droit\nEn haut à droite se trouve un panneau avec plusieurs onglets. La plupart d’entre eux dépassent le cadre de ce cours, mais nous utiliserons les deux onglets suivants :\n\nEnvironment : liste les objets enregistrés par l’utilisateur dans la session en cours. Comme vous venez de démarrer une nouvelle session, votre environnement devrait être vide.\nHistory : comprend l’historique de toutes les commandes que vous avez exécutées au cours de la session actuelle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOuvrir une nouvelle session R, c’est comme redémarer son ordinateur : tout est vide et prêt pour le calcul, de la même manière qu’il n’y a aucun programme ouvert lorsque vous allumez votre ordinateur pour la première fois.\nNous vous encourageons à arrêter et à re-démarrer vos sessions R régulièrement. Parfois cela corrigera certains de vos problèmes !\n\n\n\n\nPanneau inférieur droit\nEn bas à droite se trouve un autre panneau comprenant les onglets suivants :\n\nFiles : un explorateur de fichiers pour le répertoire de travail, qui est l’emplacement du dossier dans lequel R travaille actuellement.\nPlots : là où RStudio affichera les graphiques statiques. Cet onglet devrait être vide pour le moment.\nPackages : liste de tous les paquets R installés sur votre ordinateur. Les paquets sont des collections de fonctions qui permettent d’étendre les fonctionnalités de R. Nous les aborderons plus en détail dans la prochaine leçon.\nHelp : un endroit pour lire les pages d’aide et la documentation pour les fonctions et les paquets.\nViewer : un emplacement où RStudio affichera des sorties html telles que des tableaux, des widgets interactifs ou même des tableaux de bord.\n\n\n\nPartie gauche\n\nA gauche (ou en bas à gauche si vous avez déjà quatre panneaux), vous devriez voir l’onglet console, où le code R est exécuté.\nEn haut à gauche (si vous avez quatre panneaux) se trouvent les scripts R ouverts.\n\n\n\n\nLa console\nLa console est l’endroit où le code R s’exécute.\nAu début d’une nouvelle session, un texte d’information sur votre cofiguration apparaît tout en haut de la console, dont le numéro et nom de la version de R. En dessous de ces informations, il y a une ligne avec le symbole &gt; et un curseur clignotant.\nPour exécuter une commande dans R, tapez-la à la suite du &gt; et pressez Entrée. R traitera alors votre code et affichera le résultat (s’il y en a un). Un nouveau &gt; s’affichera alors sur la ligne suivante, indiquant que la console est prête pour la commande suivante.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nSi la dernière ligne est préfacée d’un + au lieu d’un &gt;, cela signifie que la console n’est pas prête. Soit elle attend qu’un calcul d’une commande précédente finisse, soit elle attend la fin d’une commande incomplète. A tout moment, vous pouvez interrompre l’exécution en pressant la touche Echap.\n\n\n\nExécutez les commandes suivantes dans la console, une ligne à la fois, et observez les résultats.\n\n5 + 90\n\n6 * 171\n\n189 / 36.6\n\n92^3\n\n(12 + 9)^4 / 1000\n\nExécutez maintenant la commande suivante. Notez que le ) fermant est manquant, ce qui rend la commande incomplète. Que se passe-t-il ?\n\n3 / (2 + 97\n\n\nVous avez peut-être noté dans les exemples précédents que notre code contient beaucoup d’espaces. C’est en effet une bonne pratique que d’inclure des espaces autour de la plupart des opérateurs, tels que +, -, *, /, &lt;, &gt;, = et &lt;-. Ces espaces facilitent la lecture et la compréhension de votre code, et dans certains cas (rares) ils permettent d’éviter des erreurs. Néanmoins, certains opérateurs ne doivent pas être entourés d’espaces, tels que ^, . et :.\n\n1+29+4.8/3*3           # Mauvais\n1 + 29 + 4.8 / 3 * 3   # Bien\n\n1 ^ 2  # Mauvais\n1^2    # Bien\n\nNous pouvons également exécuter des fonctions dans la console. Nous aborderons les fonctions plus en détail plus tard mais sachez que les fonctions dans R sont similaires aux fonctions dans Excel (telles que SOMME ou MOYENNE).\n\nExécutez les commandes suivantes dans la console (une ligne à la fois).\n\n# Trouvez la valeur minimale\nmin(5, 10)\nmin(1, 8, 56, 0.3)\n\n# Trouvez la valeur maximale\nmax(568, 258, 314)\n\n\n\n\nScripts\nLes scripts sont des fichiers texte qui contiennent une série de commandes pour un langage de programmation particulier. L’extension du fichier indique le langage dans lequel les commandes sont écrites. Ici nous utiliserons l’extension .R. Les scripts nous permettent de créer du code qui peut être réutilisé, partagé et même automatisé.\n\nÉcrire son premier script\nPour créer un nouveau script, allez dans le menu File &gt; New File &gt; R Script. Alternativement, cliquez sur la petite icône avec un + vert sur une page blanche située en dessous du menu File. Ou encore, utilisez le raccourci clavier CTRL + MAJ + N. Ce nouveau script non sauvegardé apparaîtra sous la forme d’un document vierge dans le panneau supérieur gauche.\n\n\n\nEtapes pour créer un nouveau script dans RStudio\n\n\nPour enregistrer votre script, utilisez le menu File &gt; Save As ou le raccourci clavier CTRL + S.\n\nCréez un script et enregistrez-le sous le nom decouverte.R(n’oubliez l’extension !). Pour l’instant, vous pouvez l’enregistrer sur votre bureau ou à tout autre endroit pratique, mais nous aborderons l’organisation des scripts dans la prochaine session.\n\n\n\nExécuter du code à partir d’un script\nPour exécuter du code à partir d’un script, placez votre curseur sur la ligne que vous souhaitez exécuter (ou sélectionnez plusieurs lignes) et effectuez l’une des opérations suivantes :\n\nCliquez sur le bouton Run en haut à droite de la fenêtre de script\nUtilisez le raccourci CTRL + Entrée (le curseur passera ensuite à la ligne suivante)\nUtiliser le raccourci ALT + Entrée (le curseur restera sur la ligne actuelle)\n\n\nCopiez le code que vous aviez exécuté dans la console lors des exercices précédents dans votre script et exécutez-le en testant les différentes méthodes ci-dessus.\nA partir de maintenant, vous écrirez votre code dans votre script et l’exécuterez à partir de là, sauf indication contraire de notre part.\n\n\n\nCommentaires\nDans R, le code qui est précédé d’un # (dièse) n’est pas exécuté, il est juste ignoré jusqu’à la fin de la ligne. C’est donc un bon moyen de documenter votre code.\n\n# Ceci est un commentaire\n\n2 + 3  # Ceci est aussi un commentaire\n\nIl est utile pour vous et vos collègues de commencer vos scripts par quelques lignes commentées fournissant des informations importantes sur le contenu de votre script.\n\n# IMPORT & PREPARATION DES DONNEES #\n# Auteure :  Mathilde Mousset\n# Date de création : 23/11/2024\n# Dernière mise à jour : 28/01/2024\n# Description : Importat et nettoyage des données de surveillance rougeole de Moissala\n\n\nAjoutez quelques commentaires au début de votre script pour le décrire.\n\nLes commentaires sont également un moyen pratique de diviser les scripts longs en sections thématiques, telles que “Import des données”, “Analyse”, “Visualisation”, etc. Par exemple :\n\n# NOM DE LA SECTION 1 -----------------------------------------------             \n\n# NOM DE LA SECTION 2 -----------------------------------------------             \n\n\nUtilisez les commentaires pour créer des sections dans votre script qui correspondent aux sections principales de ce tutoriel.\n\nEnfin, les commentaires permettent de prendre des notes sur votre code pour aider à la compréhension (celle de votre “moi futur” et celle de vos collègues). On entend souvent le conseil de se focaliser sur les commentaires qui expliquent le “pourquoi” plutôt que le “quoi”, car le “quoi” d’un code bien écrit devrait être clair.\nPar exemple, ce commentaire est superflu :\n\n1 + 3  # Code pour additionner un et trois\n\nEn comparaison, voici quelques cas où un commentaire est mérité :\n\nVous définissez une constante, une valeur seuil de séroprévalence par exemple. Ajoutez un commentaire indiquant la référence d’où provient la valeur.\nVotre code contient une valeur ou un nom de fichier qui doit être mis à jour chaque semaine. Indiquez le dans un commentaire afin que toute personne utilisant le code en soit informée.\nVous utilisez une commande contre-intuitive de premier abord, ou un paquet rare que votre collègue ne connaît peut-être pas. Commentez pour expliquer vos raisons.\n\nCeci étant dit, vous êtes en plein apprentissage, et les scripts que vous écrivez pendant ce cours sont l’équivalent de vos notes de cours, alors n’hésitez pas à utiliser autant de commentaires que vous le souhaitez pour expliquer les commandes et vous rappeler de ce qu’elles font. Vous écrirez naturellement moins de commentaires avec la pratique, lorsque les choses qui nouvelles aujourd’hui deviendront naturelles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nCommentez une ligne sélectionnée avec le raccourci CTRL + MAJ + C.\nAjoutez une section de premier niveau avec CTRL + MAJ + R.\n\n\n\nAjoutez quelques commentaires pour décrire le code que vous avez écrit jusqu’à présent dans votre script."

Ceux que nous verrons le plus souvent dans ce cours sont les suivants :\n\nnumérique [numeric en anglais]\nchaîne de caractères (texte) [string en anglais]\nbooléen (VRAI / FAUX) [boolean en anglais]\ndate [date]\nfacteur [factor]\n\n\nNumérique\nLe type numérique englobe les entiers [integers en anglais] et les doubles (nombres décimaux). Les nombres en R n’ont pas de signalétique, tapez simplement la valeur brute dans votre script ou votre console.\n\n\nChaînes de caractères\nLes chaînes de caractères [strings] représentent le texte en R. Elles sont tapées en entourant votre texte de guillemets simples ou doubles, \"district\" ou 'cas' par exemple (les guillemets doubles sont généralement considérés comme la meilleure pratique).\n\nComparez la sortie dans la console pour les commandes suivantes :\n\n28         # numérique\n\"28\"       # texte\n28 + \"28\"  # donne une erreur\n\n\nLa dernière commande ci-dessus a renvoyé une erreur car nous ne pouvons pas effectuer d’opérations arithmétiques combinant du texte et des nombres.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nR est sensible à la casse (majuscules ou minuscules), ce qui signifie que \"ABC\" n’est pas équivalent à \"abc\".\n\n\n\nSi vous souhaitez créer une chaîne de caractères contenant des guillemets, il faut échapper les guillements les faisant précéder d’un \\. Par exemple : \"Elle dit \\\"Bonjour\\\" et s'en alla\" ou 'C\\'est une belle journée'. Si vous avez utilisé des guillements doubles pour créer votre chaîne de caractères, vous pouvez utiliser des guillemets simples à l’intérieur de celle-ci (par exemple : \"C'est une belle journée\") et vice versa (par exemple : 'Elle dit \"Bonjour\" et s'en alla').\n\n\n\nBooléen (logique)\nLe type booléen (ou logique) stocke des valeurs vrai/faux et est créé en écrivant soit TRUE [VRAI] ou FALSE [FAUX] sans guillemets.\nEn interne, R traduit TRUE et FALSE en équivalents numériques 1 et 0 respectivement, ce qui peut être utile pour des opérations arithmétiques.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nVous verrez peut-être des personnes qui utilisent T ou F mais c’est déconseillé car T et F peuvent également être utilisés comme noms d’objets ou de variables. En revanche, les valeurs TRUE et FALSE sont réservées (protégées), ce qui signifie qu’elles ne peuvent pas être réaffectés à une autre valeur.\n\n\n\n\nDéterminer le type d’un objet\nIl existe plusieurs fonctions permettant de déterminer le type d’un objet (souvent appelé la classe de l’objet en R [class].\n\nTapez les commandes suivantes dans votre script et exécutez-les :\n\n# Obtenir le type\nclass(28)  \nclass(\"Mandoul\")\n\n# Test du type\nis.numeric(28)\nis.numeric(\"Mandoul\")\nis.character(\"Mandoul\")\n\nis.numeric(TRUE)\nis.character(TRUE)\nis.logical(FALSE)"

    "text": "Enregistrer un objet\nEn R, presque tout est un objet y compris les fonctions, les vecteurs et les structures plus complexes. Souvent, nous souhaitons réutiliser certains objets tout au long d’un script (un jeu de données par exemple). Il est donc très utile de les stocker dans notre environnement (la mémoire de R). Pour ce faire, nous utilisons l’opérateur d’assignation &lt;-.\n\nRegardez le panneau environnement en haut à droite. Il devrait être vide. Tapez la commande suivante dans votre script et exécutez-la. Elle enregistre une variable appelée cas dans votre environnement.\n\ncas &lt;- 28\n\nInspectez à nouveau l’environnement. Est-il toujours vide ?\n\nSi vous souhaitez accéder à la valeur de votre nouvel objet, cas il vous suffit d’exécuter son nom.\n\ncas\n\n[1] 28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNous écrivons les chaînes de caractères entre guillements pour permettre à R de faire la différence entre un objet cas et le texte \"cas\".\n\n\nUne fois créés, les objets peuvent être utilisés dans d’autres commandes :\n\ncas + 5\n\n[1] 33\n\n\n\nDans votre script, créez un objet appelé region qui contient la valeur \"Mandoul\". Est-il bien apparu dans votre environnement ?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nN’oubliez pas que nous devons toujours entourer l’opérateur &lt;- par des espaces afin d’améliorer la lisibilité et d’éviter les erreurs.\n\nx&lt;-3     # MAUVAIS\nx &lt;- 3   # BIEN\n\n\n\n\nMettre à jour d’un objet\nNous souhaitons souvent mettre à jour la valeur stockée dans un objet. Pour ce faire, il suffit d’assigner une nouvelle valeur avec la même syntaxe que celle utilisée lors de la création de l’objet :\n\ncas &lt;- 32\n\n\nMettez à jour l’objet region avec la valeur \"Moyen Chari\".\n\n\n\nNoms d’objets\nPour nommer vos objets, il existe quelques règles (relativement) strictes :\n\nNe pas commencer par un chiffre\nNe pas utiliser d’espaces (utiliser un _ à la place)\nNe pas utiliser de valeurs réservées (comme TRUE et FALSE) ou des noms de fonctions (comme mean)\nNe pas utiliser de majuscules (c’est plus une convention qu’une règle dure)\n\nAu-delà de ces règles, il existe également des bonnes pratiques plus subjectives et des styles personnels. En règle générale, les noms doivent être courts et descriptifs :\n\na &lt;- 19                              # Pas informatif\nage_du_patient_a_l_admission &lt;- 19   # Trop long\nage &lt;- 19                            # Concis et précis\n\nDes noms clairs et informatifs contribuent à rendre votre code plus lisible, ce qui permet aux autres de le comprendre facilement sans avoir à constamment consulter le dictionnaire de données."

    "section": "Structures de données",
    "text": "Structures de données\nJusqu’à maintenant, nous avons créé des objets simples qui contenaient une seule valeur. A présent nous allons nous intéresser à des structures plus complexes qui peuvent contenir des jeux de données.\n\nVecteurs\nIl est possible de rassembler plusieurs valeurs (telles que des valeurs numériques ou des chaînes de caractères) en un seul objet, appelé vecteur.\nTechniquement, il existe plusieurs types de vecteurs, dont :\n\nles vecteurs simples (ou vecteurs atomiques) ne peuvent contenir qu’un seul type de valeurs. Par exemple, un vecteur d’entiers contenant 2, 4, 6 ou un vecteur de texte contenant \"Mandoul\", \"Moyen Chari\".\nles vecteurs récursifs (généralement appelés listes) sont plus complexes et peuvent contenir plusieurs dimensions et types de données. Nous ne les aborderons pas dans cette leçon.\n\nCette leçon n’entrera pas dans les détails abstraits de ces structures et se concentrera sur celles que vous rencontrerez le plus souvent dans votre travail.\n\nVecteurs simples\nLes vecteurs simples peuvent contenir une ou plusieurs valeurs d’un seul type de données. Ils ont donc deux propriétés essentielles : une longueur et un type. Dans le cadre de ce cours, nous utiliserons indifféremment les termes “vecteur simple” et “vecteur”, comme c’est généralement le cas dans la communauté R.\nTechniquement, vous avez déjà créé vos premiers vecteurs simples lorsque vous avez construit les objets cas et region. Il s’agissait de vecteurs avec une longueur de taille une. Pour créer un vecteur avec plus d’une valeur, nous utiliserons la fonction c() (moyen mnémotechnique) :\n\ncas &lt;- c(2, 5, 8, 0, 4)\n\n\nMettez à jour cas avec les valeurs ci-dessus et mettez à jour region pour créer un vecteur de chaînes de caractères contenant les valeurs suivantes : Mandoul, Moyen-Chari, Logone Oriental, Tibesti et Logone Occidental.\n\nNous pouvons maintenant utiliser des fonctions sur les objets que nous avons créés :\n\nmean(cas)  # Calcule la moyenne des valeurs stockées dans le vecteur\n\n[1] 3.8\n\ntoupper(region)  # Convertit les valeurs du vecteur en majuscules\n\n[1] \"MANDOUL\"           \"MOYEN-CHARI\"       \"LOGONE ORIENTAL\"  \n[4] \"TIBESTI\"           \"LOGONE OCCIDENTAL\"\n\n\n\nEcrivez des commandes dans votre script pour effectuer les actions suivantes :\n\ncalculer la somme des valeurs de cas avec la fonction sum()\nconvertir le texte de region en minuscules à l’aide de la fonction tolower()\n\n\n\n\n\nAccès aux valeurs d’un vecteur\nIl est possible d’accéder à une valeur d’un vecteur en donnant son indice (i.e. sa position dans le vecteur) entre crochets :\n\ncas[2]   # Deuxième valeur de cas\n\n[1] 5\n\ncas[10]  # Dixième valeur de cas\n\n[1] NA\n\n\nOups il n’y a pas de dixième valeur dans cas ! Nous reviendrons sur ce que ce NA signifie dans la section valeurs manquantes.\nNous pouvons également accéder à une plage de valeurs, comme nous pourrions le faire dans Excel. Nous utilisons l’opérateur : entre la position minimum et maximum de la plage :\n\ncas[2:4]  # de la deuxième à la quatrième valeur\n\n[1] 5 8 0\n\n\n\nAffichez la 3ème valeur du vecteur region.\nAccédez aux valeurs “Mandoul” et “Moyen-Chari” du vecteur region.\n\n\n\nData frames\nLes data frames sont des structures tabulaires / tableaux en 2D avec des lignes et des colonnes. Il s’agit d’une structure très similaire à celle d’un “tableau” dans Excel. En tant qu’épidémiologistes, ce type d’objet est l’un des plus utiles et vous l’utiliserez quotidiennement pour stocker des jeux de données (des listes linéaires par exemple).\n\nCréation d’un data frame\nNous créons un data frame avec la fonction data.frame() :\n\ndata.frame(col1 = c(1, 4, 2, 9),\n           col2 = c(\"un peu de texte\", \"plus de text\", \"Salut !\", \"les epidemiologistes !\"))\n\n  col1                   col2\n1    1        un peu de texte\n2    4           plus de text\n3    2                Salut !\n4    9 les epidemiologistes !\n\n\nIci, on a crée col1 à partir d’un vecteur numérique, et col2 à partir d’un vecteur de chaînes de caractères. Nous avons choisi les noms des colonnes (col1 et col2), ce qui est normal, mais vous pouvez exécuter le code sans nommer les colonnes pour voir comment R crée lui même des noms.\n\nDans votre script, créez un data frame nomé data_cas qui contient cas dans une colonne et region dans l’autre.\n\n\n\nExploration d’un data frame\nL’objet data_cas devrait maintenant apparaître dans votre environnement. Vous pouvez cliquer sur le cercle bleu avec un triangle blanc pour dérouler des informations supplémentaires, ou cliquer sur son nom pour le visualiser dans un onglet dans le même volet que votre script.\n\n\n\nLe data frame data_cas apparaît désormais dans l’onglet Environnement.\n\n\nIl existe plusieurs fonctions pratiques pour explorer un data frame :\n\nExécutez les commandes suivantes et essayez de déterminer le type d’informations qu’elles renvoient.\n\nstr(data_cas)     # STRucture de l'object\ndim(data_cas)     # DIMension de l'object\nnrow(data_cas)    # Nombre de lignes (row = ligne)\nncol(data_cas)    # Nombre de COLonnes\nnames(data_cas)   # noms des colonnes\n\n\nPratiquons un peu plus ! R est livré avec quelques data frames intégrés auxquels il est possible d’accéder directement, dont un appelé iris. C’est pratique pour cette session car nous n’avons pas encore appris à importer des données dans R (ne vous inquiétez pas, nous travaillerons sur des données de liste linéaire dès la prochaine session !).\nNous pouvons afficher les premières lignes de ce data frame grâce à la fonction head() [head = la tête en anglais] :\n\nhead(iris)\n\n  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species\n1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa\n2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa\n3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa\n4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa\n5          5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa\n6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa\n\n\n\nCombien de lignes et de colonnes y a-t-il dans iris? Quels sont les noms des colonnes de ce data frame ?\n\n\n\nAccéder aux données d’un data frame\nEn R, il existe plusieurs méthodes pour accéder aux lignes et/ou colonnes d’un data frame. Dans cette session d’introduction, nous nous concentrerons sur la syntaxe [row, column].\nNous pouvons utiliser un numéro (ou un intervalle) de ligne pour extraire des lignes, et des numéros (ou un intervalle) de colonnes pour extraire les colonnes. Ont peut également utiliser le nom des colonnes pour y accéder.\n\ndata_cas[1, 2]    # Afficher la valeur de la ligne 1, deuxième colonne\n\n[1] \"Mandoul\"\n\ndata_cas[1, \"region\"]   # Afficher la valeur de la lignbe 1, pour la colonne région\n\n[1] \"Mandoul\"\n\n\nSi nous voulons isoler toutes les lignes (ou colonnes), nous pouvons simplement laisser un espace à la place du numéro/nom :\n\ndata_cas[1, ]  # Extrait la première ligne (garde toutes les colonnes)\n\n  cas  region\n1   2 Mandoul\n\ndata_cas[2:4, ]   # Valeurs des lignes 2 à 4, pour toutes les colonnes\n\n  cas         region\n2   5       Sud Kivu\n3   8 Kasai oriental\n4   0          Kasai\n\ndata_cas[ , \"region\"]   # Garde toutes les lignes mais que la colonne région\n\n[1] \"Mandoul\"        \"Sud Kivu\"       \"Kasai oriental\" \"Kasai\"         \n[5] \"Haut Katanga\"  \n\n\nNous pouvons même sélectionner plusieurs indices non consécutifs en utilisant un vecteur :\n\ndata_cas[c(1, 3), ]  # Ligne 1 et 3 (toutes les colonnes)\n\n  cas         region\n1   2        Mandoul\n3   8 Kasai oriental\n\n\nSoyez attentifs, le type de l’objet renvoyé par [ ] dépend de l’indexation utilisée :\n\nstr(data_cas[1 , ])   # Renvoit un data frame\n\n'data.frame':   1 obs. of  2 variables:\n $ cas   : num 2\n $ region: chr \"Mandoul\"\n\nstr(data_cas[ , 1])   # Renvoit un vecteur\n\n num [1:5] 2 5 8 0 4\n\n\nUne syntaxe simplifiée existe pour extraire des colonnes d’un data frame :\n\ndata_cas[2]           # Renvoit la deuxième colonne (format data frame)\n\n          region\n1        Mandoul\n2       Sud Kivu\n3 Kasai oriental\n4          Kasai\n5   Haut Katanga\n\ndata_cas[\"region\"]    # Renvoit la colonne région (format data frame)\n\n          region\n1        Mandoul\n2       Sud Kivu\n3 Kasai oriental\n4          Kasai\n5   Haut Katanga\n\n\n\nEcrivez le code pour :\n\nextraire la troisième valeur de la colonne region de votre data frame\nextraire les deuxième et troisième valeurs de la colonne cas\ncalculer la somme des valeurs de la colonne cas"

    "text": "Fonctions\nLes fonctions sont des objets qui contiennent des commandes (au lieu de valeurs) qui sont exécutées chaque fois que la fonction est lancée. Vous êtes sans doute familiers avec les fonctions dans Excel, telles que la fonction SOMME() ou la fonction MOYENNE(). Bonne nouvelle, les fonctions sont similaires dans R !\nLa majorité des fonctions que vous allez utiliser ont besoin d’informations complémentaires : a minima des données, mais aussi d’autres paramètres. On appelle ces informations des arguments. Les arguments sont normalement nommés.\nPar exemple, lorsque nous avons exécuté la commande sum(cas), nous avons fourni le vecteur cas comme premier (et seul) argument de la fonction sum().\nParmis les arguments d’une fonction, certains peuvent être obligatoires, d’autres facultatifs. Le premier argument est presque toujours obligatoire et est souvent un data frame ou un vecteur de données. Comme c’est un argument évident, on omet souvent son nom (il vous a sans doute semblé naturel de taper mean(cas) au lieu de mean(x = cas)).\nLes arguments facultatifs, en revanche, sont généralement utilisés avec neur nom. Par exemple : mean(cas, na.rm = TRUE). Les arguments facultatifs sont souvent fournis avec des valeurs par défaut raisonnables, ce qui fait que l’utilisateur ne les spécifie que lorsqu’il a besoin de changer ces valeurs par défaut. Par exemple, l’argument na.rm de la fonction mean() controle comment les valeurs manquantes sont gérées lors du calcul de la moyenne [“na” en référence aux valeurs manquantes NA, et “rm” comme raccourci de “ReMove”, que l’on peut traduire dans ce contexte par enlever ou ignorer]. Par défault, la valeur de na.rm est FALSE Ainsi, par défaut, la moyenne de données avec des valeurs manquantes renverra toujours NA :\n\nmean(c(1, 3, NA))\n\n[1] NA\n\n\nCeci est vrai pour de nombreuses opérations arithmétiques dans R. Si l’on veut que que R calcule la moyenne sur toutes les données disponibles et ignore les valeurs manquantes, nous devons explicitement fournir l’argument na.rm = TRUE:\n\nmean(c(1, 3, NA), na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nLes arguments sont séparés par des virgules.\nCes virgules doivent toujours être suivies d’un espace\nChaque fois qu’un argument nommé est utilisé, l’attribut = doit être entouré d’espaces :\n\n\nmean(cas,na.rm=TRUE)     # MAUVAIS\nmean(cas, na.rm = TRUE)  # BON\n\nSi vous écrivez une commande avec de nombreux arguments, séparez chaque argument sur sa propre ligne pour améliorer la lisibilité :\n\nmean(cas, \n     na.rm = TRUE) \n\n\n\nQue se passe-t-il si l’on fournit plusieurs arguments dans le désordre ? Si vous avez nommé les arguments la fonction s’exécutera correctement, mais le code sera contre-intuitif et peu lisible. Nous vous conseillons de respecter l’ordre standard, en plaçant les arguments obligatoires tels que les données en premier.\n\n# Fonctionnel mais dur à lire\nmean(na.rm = TRUE,  \n     x = cas) \n\n# mieux\nmean(cas,         \n     na.rm = TRUE)\n\nEn revanche, si vous ne nommez pas les arguments et les passez dans le désordre, alors la fonction ne fonctionnera pas comme prévu, voire renverra une erreur :\n\nmean(TRUE, cas)  # Pas ce que vous attendez"

    "text": "Setting up your Project\n\nFolder Structure\n\nIf not done already, download and unzip the course folder. Save the uncompressed folder to a location that is not connected to OneDrive and navigate into it.\n\n\n\n  Course Folder\n\n\n\n\nThis folder gives an example of a typical (and highly recommended) structure for your code projects:\n\n📁 data\n\n📁 clean\n📁 raw\n\n📁 R\n📁 outputs\n\nThis folder will be you working directory for all the sessions of this course. You will create an Rstudio project in it (explanations below), and save all your scripts in /R. The course datasets are already in data/raw.\n\n\nDefinitions\nTo work through this session you need to understand the two following concepts:\nWorking directory. The working directory is the location (folder) where your R session is actively working. If you save a file, for example, it will be saved into this folder by default. Similarly, when you want to open a file, this folder will be shown by default. All relative paths will be relative to this working directory. By default, R usually picks the “Documents” folder as the working directory on Windows machines.\nRoot. The root refers to the top-most folder level of the working directory. If your course folder was called FETCHR, the root would then be directly inside it (as opposed to being inside one of its subfolders like R or Data).\n\n\nRStudio Projects\nAn RStudio Project can be used to make your life easier and help orient RStudio around the various files used in your code\nAs a quick reminder, your interface should look something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Screenshot of a typical Rstudio interface\n\n\n\n\nOpen RStudio and create a new project by clicking File &gt; New Project &gt; Existing Directory &gt; Browse, navigating into (opening) the course folder, and clicking Create Project.\n\n\nIn the Windows Explorer, look at the course folder. You should now see a new file with the extention .Rproj that has a small blue icon with an R in it.\n\n\n\n\nIcon associated with RStudio projects\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you don’t see this file, it’s probably because it is hidden by default on your computer. To change this setting in Windows Explorer, go into the View menu and select Filename Extensions.\n\n\nWhen you open an RStudio Project, RStudio starts a new R session, opens the associated project files, and sets your working directory to the root of the course folder. At this time, RStudio also displays the subfolders of this directory in the panel on the bottom right.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIt is strongly recommended to set up a separate RStudio Project for each of your analyses to ensure that your project files remain organized and manageable.\n\n\nThere are several ways to open an RStudio Project:\n\nUse the RStudio menu File &gt; Open Project and then select the relevant .Rproj file\nClick on the Project: (none) button on the top right of the RStudio interface\nNavigate in the folder explorer to the analysis folder and double click on the file with the .Rproj extension\n\n\n\nRStudio Options\nBefore continuing, let’s update some of RStudio’s problematic default settings:\n\nOpen the global options (Tools &gt; Global Options) and open the tab General (left menu). Make sure that none of the boxes in the sections R Sessions, Workspace, or History are checked.\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of the Rstudio options\n\n\nWhen checked, these options cause RStudio to save the objects in your environment and reload them as well as any files you previously had open when you open a new R session. While these default may seem like a good idea, it is better to always start your work from a fresh, empty R session to avoid bugs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nRemember that any commands or outputs that is needed for the cleaning and analysis should be saved explicitly in a script in the correct, functional order."

What happens if you don’t do this?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you are following this session as part of a course, to avoid any potential internet connectivity issues during the training we already had you install most of the course packages.\nIf are following this tutorial on your own or have not installed the packages yet, you will have to manually install each new package that we encounter.\n\n\n\n\nUsage\nOnce a package is installed we can use it but we have to specify to R that we will be using it every single session. This process is called loading the package and is achieved using the function library().\n\nlibrary(here) # load the \"here\" package\n\n\nUse the library() function to load the packages here and rio, which will be used in the next section.\n\nBased on your computer’s set up and the package you are trying to load, you may get a warning message noting that some functions have been masked or that the current version of the package was built for a different version of R. These messages are not usually a problem but are still important to note.\n\nTry to run the following code. Can you work out what the error means?\n\nlibrary(ggplot)\n\n\nThe above code throws an error because you have asked for a library that doesn’t exist. Remember that R is fickle and case sensitive and many of your errors will come from small typos in the names of functions or objects. Here, for example, we wanted to load the package ggplot2 but wrote ggplot instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nMost of the time, you’ll need to load a number of packages for your script and it is recommended to have a section at the start of your code that loads everything you’ll need in one place:\n\n# Packages ----------------------------\nlibrary(tidyverse)   # data manipulation\nlibrary(lubridate)   # date manipulation\n\nThis practice makes it easy to tell which packages need to be installed to run a script.\n\n\n\nUse comments to create a “Packages” section to your script.\n\n\n\nUpdating Packages\nR has a very active community of developers and it’s pretty common for packages to be updated from time to time as their owners add in new functions and fix existing bugs. In order to update the packages in your library, you can go into the Packages tab of the bottom right panel and click Update. Don’t forget that you’ll need to be connected to the internet during this process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nSometimes packages are updated in a way that might remove or change a function that you used in some of your scripts, causing your code to no longer work. Don’t panic if this happens. The best practice is to adapt your code, although in the worst case scenario you can forcibly install an old version of a package. This is however out of the scope of this session."

    "section": "Data Importation",
    "text": "Data Importation\n\nUnderstanding File Paths\nTo open a file in R you need to provide a file path. A file path is simply a longer name for a file, that includes not only its name but also its location on your computer. There are several ways of defining these paths, including absolute and relative paths.\n\nAbsolute Paths\nAbsolute paths are specific to your computer and go all the way up to the level of your hard drive. For example, an absolute path may look something like this: D:/OneDrive - MSF/Documents/monitoring/cholera/fancy_project/data/raw/example_linelist.xlsx. Clearly, this path will only work on one specific computer.\nThe use of hard coded absolute paths is strongly discouraged as it makes your code inflexible and prone to break: the paths need to be updated every time your code is shared or the project folder is moved on your computer.\n\n\nRelative Paths\nRelative paths are defined relatively to your current working directory. For example, keeping in mind that our handy .Rproj file set our working directory to the root of our project folder, we could create a relative path that looked like data/raw/example_linelist.xlsx. This means that as long as we maintain the internal structure of our project folder and have an .Rproj file, our code would theoretically run on multiple computers.\n\n\nRobust Paths with the here() function\nThe {here} package has a here() function that really helps defining paths. It has two advantages:\n\nWhen used with RStudio projects, you can give it only the part of the path within the project, (the relative path in other words), and the function uses it to create the absolute path dynamically.\nIt does so using the separator adapted to you operating system, whether it’s /, \\, or //\n\n\nlibrary(here)\nhere(\"data\", \"raw\", \"example_linelist.xlsx\")\n\n[1] \"/home/catherine/Documents/epicentre/training/repicentre/data/raw/example_linelist.xlsx\"\n\n\nSee how we only defined the relative path and the function created an absolute path. This way of defining the path will work on your colleagues computer, even if they run on another operating system, as long as you both respect the internal structure of the working directory.\nWe strongly encourage you to use here() whenever you need to create a file path.\n\nRun the above code in the console. What file path does here(\"data\", \"raw\") give you?\n\n\nUsing here(), create a complete file path for the file Moissalla-measles-linelist-EN.xlsx. Keep this path around, we will use it soon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nhere() simply creates a file path, it doesn’t actually check if a file exists on your computer: if the file is absent or there is a typo in your code, the command will yield an error when the path is used. If you would like to use a function to check if a file exists, check out the file.exists() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWe will often want to source multiple data files in a single project. To make that process easier, it can be helpful to create a section at the start of the script, after loading the packages to define paths and store them in variables.\n\n\n\n\n\nImport function\nIn R different file formats are often imported using different, often specialized functions. This can be tedious as it requires you to memorize and load a large number of functions just to get your data imported. To avoid this problem, we recommend that you use the import() function from the package {rio}. This function is able to open a large variety of files (including Excel, csv, Stata, and many others) by recognizing the file extension of your data and calling a relevant specialized function from another package so that you don’t have to.\nBecause import() is actually just calling other functions in the background, it is possible that it will need different arguments depending on the type of file you want to load.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTo see the full list of all the file types you can load (and save!) with rio, check out the list of supported formats on their website. In the rest of the lesson we will focus on importing data from Excel .xlsx files.\n\n\n\nImporting from the First Sheet\nIn general, the usage of import() is pretty simple, at minima you need to pass the path of the file to the file argument\n\nimport(file = here(\"data\", \"raw\", \"example_linelist.xlsx\"))\n\nNotice that we have nested the command here() inside the import() command. Nesting functions is absolutely allowed in R and is something you will do all the time. When functions are nested, R will evaluate them in the order of the innermost function (in this case here()) to the outermost (in this case import()). In this way, the output of here() is being used as the input of import().\n\nImport the file Moissalla-measles-linelist-EN.xlsx that is in your raw data subfolder into R using here() and import().\n\nIf your import worked correctly, R will print the data into the console but not save it into the environment because we have not assigned them to an object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou may not want to have R print very large datasets into the console and assign them directly to an object.\n\n\n\nReimport your data but this time save it to an object called df_linelist.\n\n\n\nImporting Data from Any Sheet\nAs you just saw, R selects the first sheet by default. It is however possible to pass the number (or name) of a specific worksheet in your Excel data to import() using the argument which:\n\nimport(file = here(\"data\", \"raw\", \"example_linelist.xlsx\"),\n       which = 2)  # imports the second sheet\n\nNote that the which argument is specific to the file types that have multiple sheets, such as Excel or .Rdata files. If you try to use it on a .csv file the argument will be ignored."

The natural next step is to inspect this dataset, to check that the import went well, get to know it a bit better, and assess if it requires any cleaning before analysis.\nWe can start by taking a quick look at the first few lines of the dataframe using the function head(). This function takes a dataframe as its first argument and optionally accepts a second argument n indicating the number of lines we would like to see.\n\nhead(df_linelist, n = 10) # Inspect 10 first lines\n\n\nUse head() to examine the 12 first lines of df_linelist.\n\nWe can also check out our data by looking at the Environment tab of the top-right panel. Here, we can see our dataframe in the environment, look at its structure, or open it in the data viewer of RStudio.\n\nClick on the round blue button next to df_linelist in your environment to see its structure. Then click on the name of the dataset to open it in the viewer.\n\nThe data viewer displays dataframes as tables and is a convenient way to quickly look at your data. You can even sort and filter your data in the “View”, though be aware that these actions will not make any changes to the actual object df_linelist. The View can also be opened by passing the dataframe to the function View()."
