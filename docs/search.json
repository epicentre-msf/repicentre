    "section": "Paradigms of Plotting",
    "text": "Paradigms of Plotting\nIn R, and indeed in everything, there are a lot of ways to approach data visualization. Two of the biggest paradigms are :\n\nThe All-In-One: this approach is characterized by having a single, typically somewhat complex, function that handles all aspects of building a plot. Base R as well as a variety of specialized packages tend to use this approach.\nLayered (or modular): here, instead of creating a plot with a single function, we will use separate functions to add (or modify) different features of a plot (such as the primary shapes, labels, error bars, themes, etc). This is the strategy used by packages like {ggplot2}, {highcharter}, or {echarts4r}.\n\nAn in depth discussion of why one might use one approach versus another is beyond the scope of this course, though we will note that most modern visualization packages tend to use a layered model. With that in mind, let’s take a look at the types of layers we are talking about in our “layered” approach.\n\nBreaking it Down: A Visualization and its Parts\nFor the purpose of this tutorial we will talk about only four visualization components (layers):\n\nCanvas / Data\nPrimary Shapes\nLabels\nTheme\n\nTo illustrate these components, let’s look at a basic schematic of an epicurve:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most conceptually complex of the above layers is probably the canvas itself. Much as an artist needs to buy a canvas and conceptualize what they want to paint before they start painting, so too does a user of {ggplot2}. Creating the canvas is where we tell R that we want to start making a plot and what parts of the data that plot will use. Here, for example, we will tell R “I want to make a plot where the x axis represents dates (or weeks sometimes) and the y axis represents cases”. Once that canvas is set up we can start adding other layers in the same way that an artist would begin adding paint, their signature, or a frame.\nNow, let’s look at the syntax for these layers in {ggplot2} and how to put them together.\n\n\nGetting Started with {ggplot2}\nThe method of building a ggplot is relatively simple and takes the form:\n\nCreate a canvas using a duo of functions ggplot(aes(...))\nAdd things to the canvas\n\n{ggplot2} takes the idea of “adding something to the canvas” very literally: each new layer will be introduced to your plot using the + sign.\nThe general syntax of a ggplot is then:\n\n# DO NOT RUN (PSEUD-CODE)\ndf |&gt;                      # pipe in your data \n  ggplot(aes(x = ...,      # step 1: create canvas\n             y = ...)) +\n  layer_one(...) +         # step 2: add a first layer\n  layer_two(...) +         # step 3: add another layer\n  ...                      # continue adding layers...\n\nThe number of layers you add depends on how complex you want your plot to be. In our case, we will be adding three layers to our canvas with the following functions:\n\n# DO NOT RUN (PSEUD-CODE)\ndf |&gt;                    # pipe in your data\n  ggplot(aes(x = ...,     # step 1: create canvas\n             y = ...)) +\n  geom_col(...) +         # step 2: add shapes (bars)        \n  labs(...) +             # step 3: add titles\n  theme_classic(...)      # step 4: add a nicer theme\n\nWe can update our above schematic of an epicurve with these functions as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNotice that in the above example, our very first line is actually our dataset being piped into the ggplot() function. This makes sense since {ggplot2} needs to know what data you’d like to visualize. But be careful, make sure that this line ends in a pipe (|&gt;) and not in a + sign like t |&gt; he other ones.\n\n\nIn the next part of the tutorial we will go through each of these steps (layers) individually using our course dataset to make your first epicurve."

    "section": "Building Your First ggplot",
    "text": "Building Your First ggplot\n\nPreparing Your Data: Aggregate by Day\nUltimately we would like to plot an epicurve of daily cases. You may have noticed, our current data is daily, but of course several cases may occur on some days. To plot an epicurve we will need to aggregate data by day. Fortunately, you already learned how to summarize data in previous sessions.\n\nUsing count(), create a new dataframe called df_cases that summarizes the total number of cases observed per day. The head of this data frame should look like this:\n\n\n  date_onset n\n1 2022-08-13 1\n2 2022-08-17 1\n3 2022-08-18 1\n4 2022-08-22 1\n5 2022-08-30 2\n6 2022-09-01 1\n\n\n\nGreat! Now we are ready to make our epicurve. In the following steps, you’ll be asked to use df_cases to plot a classic epicurve of the number of daily admissions. To demonstrate the functions you’ll be using, I will plot the curve of the number of daily hospitalizations as an example. To do that, I’ve built myself another dataframe, df_outcome, which looks like this:\n\n\n  date_admission patients\n1     2022-08-14        1\n2     2022-08-25        1\n3     2022-09-02        1\n4     2022-09-06        1\n5     2022-09-09        1\n6     2022-09-10        1\n\n\n\n\nSet up a Canvas: Initialize a Plot\nThe first step is creating your canvas by specifying your dataset and the names of the columns you’d like to visualize. This is done using ggplot(aes(...)) with the following syntax:\n\n# DO NOT RUN (PSEUD-CODE)\ndf_data |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = x_axis_variable_name,\n             y = y_axis_variable_name))\n\nFor an epicurve of hospitalizations, I’d like to plot the days (date_admission) on the x-axis and the number of patients hospitalized (patients) on the y-axis. Let’s update our pseudo-code to do that:\n\ndf_hospital |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = date_admission,\n             y = patients))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFabulous, take a look at that big beautiful box of potential. This is our empty canvas. In RStudio this plot should show up in the panel on the bottom right of the screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nJust like with {dplyr}, we write our column names without quotation marks. This is unsurprising as {ggplot2}, like {dplyr}, is a member of the {tidyverse} and therefore uses similar syntax.\n\n\nNow, you may be wondering what is this aes() function that we’ve nested inside of ggplot()? The short answer is that aes() creates an AESthetic mapping that tells {ggplot2} which columns of our data should be represented by which visual elements of our plot (like the axes, for example).\nAesthetic mappings create a map that defines how data elements (variables) are to be represented by visual elements (like axes, colors, and sizes). For example, here we are mapping the days to the x-axis and the number of patients to the y-axis. We could also imagine, for example, an epicurve where bars are colored based on whether patients lived or died. This would be an example where the variable outcome is being mapped to the visual element of color.\nFor now it is enough to know that aes() is the place where you will define your x-and y-axis.\n\nCreate a new section in your script called # PLOT EPICURVE. Then create an empty canvas for your epicurve using df_cases.\n\nAt this point, your plot should look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExcellent! Now let’s add some bars.\n\n\nPlot the Bars\nNow that we have our canvas, it’s time to add some shapes. In {ggplot2}, the shapes plotted on a figure are called geometries. Geometries are the primary visual representation of your data and should feel pretty familiar. A few common types of geometries include:\n\nBar Plots (geom_col() or geom_bar())\nHistograms (geom_hist())\nScatterplots (geom_point())\nLine Plots (geom_line())\nBoxplots (geom_boxplot())\n\nToday, we’re doing epicurves so we are most interested in learning how to make a bar plot. In our case, we will be using geom_col(). Remember that adding a new layer (in this case a geometry) to our ggplot is as simple as using a +, so we can add bars to the epicurve of hospitalized cases in the following way:\n\ndf_hospital |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = date_admission,\n             y = patients)) +\n  geom_col()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrilliant! That sure looks like an epicurve to me. Though it does look a bit…grey. If we’d like to update the color of our bars (called the fill), we simply need to add the fill argument to geom_col().\nLet’s give it a try:\n\ndf_hospital |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = date_admission,\n             y = patients)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"#2E4573\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate your epicurve plot to add bars with the color #E4573.\n\nYour plot should now look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn the {ggplot2} framework, layers must be added to an existing canvas. This means that running geom_col() by itself will not produce any visual output. This, however, makes sense. Continuing with our analogy of ggplots being like paintings, running geom_col() by itself would be like having paint with no canvas to put it on.\n\n\nLooking good. Now it’s time to make our plot just a bit more informative and just a bit more attractive by adding labels and a nicer theme.\n\n\nAdd Some Labels\nA good plot needs some good labeling; n is hardly an informative axis title. Fortunately, {ggplot2} makes adding labels easy with the function labs(). This function will accept a variety of arguments allowing you to add a variety of label/title elements to your plot, for example:\n\nAxis Titles (x = and y =)\nPlot Title (title =)\nCaption\n\nAs for other layers, we can include a label layer by adding labs() to our current plot with the + sign:\n\ndf_hospital |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = date_admission,\n             y = patients)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"#2E4573\") +\n  labs(x = \"Date\",\n       y = \"Daily Patients\",\n       title = \"Measles Hospitalizations in Mandoul Region (Chad)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate your epicurve plot to add some reasonable axis labels and a nice title.  Extra Credit! Try adding a data source using caption.\n\nYour plot might now look like (for example):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a Theme\nIf we wanted to, we could stop here if our goal is to produce an informal plot. Ideally, however, it would be nice to use a somewhat more attractive theme and to increase the text size. To do this, we will add one last layer to our plot: a theme layer. Much like how geometries in {ggplot2} all start with geom_, all themes start with theme_. There are several themes available to you and you can check out what they look like on the {ggplot2} website.\nToday, we will use theme_classic(), which offers a simple but elegant output:\n\ndf_hospital |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = date_admission,\n             y = patients)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"#2E4573\") +\n  labs(x = \"Date\",\n       y = \"Daily Patients\",\n       title = \"Measles Hospitalizations in Mandoul Region (Chad)\") +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOk, nice. But we’d also like to increase the size of that tiny font. To do that we can adjust the base_size argument:\n\ndf_hospital |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = date_admission,\n             y = patients)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"#2E4573\") +\n  labs(x = \"Date\",\n       y = \"Daily Patients\",\n       title = \"Measles Hospitalizations in Mandoul Region (Chad)\") +\n  theme_classic(base_size = 17)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat looks better! Keep in mind that the font size needed will depend on what the plot is going to be used for (i.e. a presentation, an informal review, or a final report). Similarly, the exact theme you will want to use is ultimately a subjective choice. While there are guidelines, data visualization is as much an art as a science.\n\nAdd one final layer to your plot that adds a theme of your choice with an appropriate base_size.\n\n\n\nSave your plot\nIf you would like to save your epicurve, you can click on the “Export” button in the plot panel of RStudio:"

    "title": "Data Manipulation, Filtering and Recoding",
    "section": "Using Conditional Logic to Filter Data",
    "text": "Using Conditional Logic to Filter Data\nIn the last session we learned a lot of the core data verbs in {dplyr} for basic manipulation tasks like selecting particular variables of interest and modifying them to better suit our needs. Beyond selecting variables of interest, another common task we have as epidemiologists is selecting observations of interest; ie: filtering our data to look at particular observations that meet a certain criteria.\nFortunately, {dplyr} has our back with the conveniently named function, filter(). To understand how to use it, however, we will need to learn a bit about how to construct conditional logic statements in R. This will be the focus of our session today.\n\nThis Equals That\nThe basic syntax of filter() is pretty simple:\n\n# DO NOT RUN (PSEUDO-CODE)\ndf_raw |&gt;\n  filter([conditional logic statement]) # Keep lines where statement is TRUE\n\nBut what is a conditional logic statement? These are statements that ask “Is this thing true?”. The simplest conditional logic statement asks “does this variable equal this value?”. For example, “was this patient hospitalized?”. In R, we can ask if one value equals another using ==.\nTo create a filter asking, for each observation, whether the value of hospitalization is equal to yes we can then use the following syntax:\n\ndf_raw |&gt;\n  filter(hospitalisation == 'yes')\n\nWhat filter() is doing here is going down each row of our dataset and asking: “for this row, is the value of hospitalisation equal to \"yes\"?”. It then returns only the rows where the answer to this question is TRUE.\n\nCreate a filter that selects all of the patients who had a fever, ie: where the value of fever was \"Yes\". The head of fever should look like this:\n\n\n  fever\n1   Yes\n2   Yes\n3   Yes\n4   Yes\n5   Yes\n6   Yes\n\n\nTake a look at your output and then take a look at the head of df_raw. Why does df_raw still contain patients who didn’t present with fever?\n\n\n\nThis Does Not Equal That\nChecking if something is the same is great, but a lot of the time we might have another question in mind. For example, we might want to know how many patients didn’t recover, whether this was because they died or because they left against medical advice.\nIn this case, instead of writing == we will instead use !=. So, for example if we want to select all observations where patients didn’t recover we would write:\n\ndf |&gt;\n  filter(outcome != 'recovered')\n\n\nCreate a filter that selects patients who did not have a card confirmed vaccination status. The head of vacc_status should look like this:\n\n\n  vacc_status\n1          No\n2  Yes - oral\n3          No\n4          No\n5          No\n6          No\n\n\nHint. Remember that you can use count() to check what the options were for vacc_status.\n\n\n\nGreater Than / Less Than\nThe other common question we have is whether a value was greater or less than a particular threshold. For example, how many patients were under 5 years old? Here we will use &lt; and &gt; to evaluate whether a variable is less than or greater than a particular value, respectively.\nFor example, to ask how many patients were less than 60 months old we can write:\n\ndf_raw |&gt;\n  filter(age &lt; 60)\n\n\nCreate a filter that selects all patients with severe accute malnutrition (ie: patients with a MUAC less than 110). The head of muac should look like this:\n\n\n  muac\n1   80\n2   88\n3   60\n4   85\n5   86\n6   68\n\n\nNow create another filter that selects patients who are over 15 years old. The head of your age column should look like this:\n\n\n  age\n1 348\n2 348\n3 312\n4 432\n5 444\n6 324\n\n\n\nSometimes, instead of asking if something is less or greater than a particular value, we want to ask if it is less than or equal to that value. Easy, we just need to add an equal sign! We write &lt;= for “less than or equal to” and &gt;= for “greater than or equal to”. Careful here, the = must come after &lt; or &gt;, not before.\nSo if we want to ask for how many patients were 10 years of age or younger, we can write:\n\ndf_raw |&gt;\n  filter(age &lt;= 120)\n\n\nCreate a filter that selects all patients with a normal nutrition status, ie: patients with a MUAC greater than or equal to 125. The head of muac should look like this:\n\n\n  muac\n1  244\n2  232\n3  210\n4  220\n5  152\n6  155\n\n\n\n\n\nFilters with Multiple Conditions\nWant to combine several logic statements in a single filter? Easy. We can create a filter with multiple conditions by simply separating each condition with a comma:\n\n# DO NOT RUN (PSEUDO-CODE)\ndf |&gt;\n  filter([condition 1],\n         [condition 2],\n         [condition 3])\n\nSo for example, let’s say we want to select all patients under five who were hospitalized. In this case we can write:\n\ndf_raw |&gt;\n  filter(age &lt; 5,\n         hospitalised = \"true\")\n\n\nCreate a filter that selects all patients with severe accute malnutrition who were hospitalized in the Koumra health facility. The head of id, sub_prefecture, hospitalisation, and muac should look like this:\n\n\n    id sub_prefecture hospitalisation muac\n1 8624         KOUMRA             yes  103\n2 8939         KOUMRA             yes   67\n3 9957         KOUMRA             yes   71\n\n\nHint. This filter has a condition on both hospitalisation status, sub_prefecture, and muac.\n\n\n\nSummary of Basic Logic Statements\nGood job working through a quick tour of logic statements in R! Here is a handy table to help you remember the main logic statements we have learned so far:\n\n\n\nStatement\nR\n\n\n\n\nIs A the same as B?\nA == B\n\n\nIs A not the same as B\nA != B\n\n\nIs A greater than B?\nA &gt; B\n\n\nIs A greater than or equal to B?\nA &gt;= B\n\n\nIs A less than B?\nA &lt; B\n\n\nIs A less than or equal to B?\nA &lt;= B"

    "text": "Recoding with case_when()\nAs we have seen, conditional logic statements are incredibly useful when trying to filter our data, but you will find that they have many other uses as well. One of their other major use cases for us as epidemiologists is when we need to recode our data. This is where the {dplyr} function case_when() is here to help us.\nThe syntax of case_when() is a little more advanced than what we have seen so far, but we will go slowly and break it down. Once you get the hang of it, case_when() will become a very powerful part of your R toolbelt.\nWe will almost always use case_when() inside of a mutate(), because we will use it either to recode an existing variable or to create a new one. The basic syntax works like this:\n\n# DO NOT RUN (PSEUDO-CODE)\ndf |&gt;\n  mutate(column_name = case_when([first condition] ~ [value when condition is TRUE],\n                                 [second condition] ~ [value when second condition is TRUE],\n                                 .default = [default value])\n\nOk, that’s a lot. Let’s break it down.\nSo the first thing to notice is that, with the exception of the last line, each line inside of case_when() has the following format:\n\n[condition] ~ [value when condition is TRUE]\n\nSo for example, if we want our case_when() to say that anytime a patient had a MUAC less than 110 we want to have a value of \"SAM\", we would have something like this:\n\nmuac &lt; 110 ~ 'SAM'\n\nWe can add multiple possible outcomes by adding additional lines. In this case, our next condition might check if the patient is moderately but not severly malnourished using the statement muac &lt; 125 ~ 'MAM'.\nThe last line, with the argument .default gives the value we want case_when() to use when none of the above conditions have been met. In this case, we might give the value 'Normal'.\nTo put this together, if we wanted to create a variable that classifies the malnutrition status of patients using their MUAC, we would write:\n\ndf_raw |&gt;\n  mutate(malnut = case_when(muac &lt; 110 ~ 'SAM',\n                            muac &lt; 125 ~ 'MAM',\n                            .default = 'Normal'))\n\n\nTry running the above code to see if it successfully creates a new column malnut with the malnutrition status of each case. You should get something like this:\n\n\n  muac malnut\n1  244 Normal\n2  232 Normal\n3  123    MAM\n4  210 Normal\n5   80    SAM\n6  220 Normal\n\n\n\nBe careful. The order of your statements is important here. What case_when() will do is go through each statement from top to bottom and assign the first value that is TRUE. So in our above example, case_when() will ask the following questions in sequence:\n\nDoes this patient have SAM (is muac &lt; 110)? If so, assign the value \"SAM\"\nIf the patient didn’t have SAM, do they have MAM (is muac &lt; 125)? If so, assign the value `“MAM”\nIf none of the above conditions were true, assign the default value \"Normal\"\n\n\nTry reordering the first and second conditions in the above case_when() so that you first check if muac &lt; 125. The head of your new data frame should now look like this:\n\n\n  muac malnut\n1  244 Normal\n2  232 Normal\n3  123    MAM\n4  210 Normal\n5   80    MAM\n6  220 Normal\n\n\nNotice anything different? Save this new data frame to a tmp object and inspect it to see if we still have any patients classified as \"SAM\". Can you figure out why this no longer gives the correct classification?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe .default argument in case_when() is not obligatory. If you don’t include it then case_when() will use NA by default.\n\n\nAs we saw in our above example, case_when() is an easy way of creating new variables based on the values of an existing column. This can be used to classify status (as we saw with malnutrition) or to regroup variables into categories (like age groups).\n\nUse case_when() to create a new variable age_group with three categories: \"&lt; 5 Years\", \"5 - 15 Years\", and \"&gt; 15 Years\". Patients missing age data should be assigned a default value of \"Unknown\". Be careful with your ordering! The head of your new column should look like this:\n\n\n  age     age_group\n1  36     &lt; 5 Years\n2   5     &lt; 5 Years\n3 156 5 - 15  Years\n4   8     &lt; 5 Years\n5   7     &lt; 5 Years\n6   4     &lt; 5 Years\n\n\n\n\nThe %in% operator\nSo now we can regroup variables into categories, great. But we can also use case_when() to standardize the values we see in a variable.\n\nUsing count() inspect the categorical variables in df_raw to check if any have inconsistencies in their coding.\n\nIn our dataset, we see that there are some issues in the way sex was coded. For example, female patients are coded as f, female and femme. That simply won’t do. Thankfully, we can use case_when() to recode this variable. This time, instead of creating a new variable we will directly update sex:\n\ndf_raw |&gt;\n  mutate(sex = case_when(sex == \"f\" ~ \"Female\",\n                         sex == \"female\" ~ \"Female\",\n                         sex == \"femme\" ~ \"Female\",\n                         sex == \"m\" ~ \"Male\",\n                         sex == \"male\" ~ \"Male\",\n                         sex == \"homme\" ~ \"Male\",\n                         .default = \"Unknown\"))\n\nWell, that works, but it seems awfully repetitive. It would be easier if we could just list all the options that we want to reassign to “Female” and “Male” respectively. This is where the %in% operator is here to help. The %in% operator will check if a value is in a vector of options using the following basic syntax:\n\n# DO NOT RUN (PSEUDO-CODE)\n[value] %in% [vector_of_options]\n\nSo, for example, we could check if the value \"f\" is in the options \"f\", \"female\" using the following:\n\n\"f\" %in% c(\"f\", \"female\")\n\n\nTry running the above statement. What is the data type of your outcome?\n\nSee how the outcome of the above statement is a boolean, ie: a logic outcome? That means we can use it as a condition in case_when()! This means that our verbose code above can now be written as:\n\ndf_raw |&gt;\n  mutate(sex = case_when(sex %in% c(\"f\", \"female\", \"femme\") ~ \"Female\",\n                         sex %in% c(\"m\", \"male\", \"homme\") ~ \"Male\",\n                         .default = \"Unknown\"))\n\nMuch nicer.\n\nUse case_when() and the %in% operator to create a new column vacc_status_strict that has the value \"Yes\" for cases with card confirmed vaccination status, \"No\" for cases who said they were unvaccinated, and \"Unverified\" otherwise. The head of your new column should look like this:\n\n\n  vacc_status_strict\n1         Unverified\n2                 No\n3         Unverified\n4                 No\n5                 No\n6                 No"

Often, however, we might prefer to use a file with the extension .rds instead. This is a file type specific to R and is more robust to issues related to encoding or date formatting than files like xlsx or csv. To save your above file as an rds all you need to do is change the extension:\n\ndf |&gt;\n  export(here('data', 'clean', 'measles_linelist_clean.rds'))"

If your course folder was called FETCHR, the root would then be directly inside it (as opposed to being inside one of its subfolders like R or Data).\n\n\nRStudio Projects\nAn RStudio Project can be used to make your life easier and help orient RStudio around the various files used in your code\nAs a quick reminder, your interface should look something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Screenshot of a typical Rstudio interface\n\n\n\n\nOpen RStudio and create a new project by clicking File &gt; New Project &gt; Existing Directory &gt; Browse, navigating into (opening) the course folder, and clicking Create Project.\n\n\nIn the Windows Explorer, look at the course folder. You should now see a new file with the extention .Rproj that has a small blue icon with an R in it.\n\n\n\n\nIcon associated with RStudio projects\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you don’t see this file, it’s probably because it is hidden by default on your computer. To change this setting in Windows Explorer, go into the View menu and select Filename Extensions.\n\n\nWhen you open an RStudio Project, RStudio starts a new R session, opens the associated project files, and sets your working directory to the root of the course folder. At this time, RStudio also displays the subfolders of this directory in the panel on the bottom right.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIt is strongly recommended to set up a separate RStudio Project for each of your analyses to ensure that your project files remain organized and manageable.\n\n\nThere are several ways to open an RStudio Project:\n\nUse the RStudio menu File &gt; Open Project and then select the relevant .Rproj file\nClick on the Project: (none) button on the top right of the RStudio interface\nNavigate in the folder explorer to the analysis folder and double click on the file with the .Rproj extension\n\n\n\nRStudio Options\nBefore continuing, let’s update some of RStudio’s problematic default settings:\n\nOpen the global options (Tools &gt; Global Options) and open the tab General (left menu). Make sure that none of the boxes in the sections R Sessions, Workspace, or History are checked.\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of the Rstudio options\n\n\nWhen checked, these options cause RStudio to save the objects in your environment and reload them as well as any files you previously had open when you open a new R session. While these default may seem like a good idea, it is better to always start your work from a fresh, empty R session to avoid bugs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nRemember that any commands or outputs that is needed for the cleaning and analysis should be saved explicitly in a script in the correct, functional order."

    "section": "Packages",
    "text": "Packages\nPackages are collections of functions that extend the functionality of R. You’ll use them a lot, both in this course and in your daily life. Fortunately, as an open source language, R packages can be downloaded and installed for free from the internet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn R, packages are referenced using {}. For example {ggplot2} is the name of the ggplot2 package that contains new plotting functions such as ggplot(), geom_point() etc…\n\n\n\nInstallation\nWe can install a new package using the function install.packages(), which downloads and installs it into the package library on your computer. This is done once per computer.\n\ninstall.packages(\"here\") # install the {here} package\n\nDon’t forget to wrap the package name in quotation marks when using install.packages(). What happens if you don’t do this?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you are following this session as part of a course, to avoid any potential internet connectivity issues during the training we already had you install most of the course packages.\nIf are following this tutorial on your own or have not installed the packages yet, you will have to manually install each new package that we encounter.\n\n\n\n\nUsage\nOnce a package is installed we can use it but we have to specify to R that we will be using it every single session. This process is called loading the package and is achieved using the function library().\n\nlibrary(here) # load the \"here\" package\n\n\nUse the library() function to load the packages here and rio, which will be used in the next section.\n\nBased on your computer’s set up and the package you are trying to load, you may get a warning message noting that some functions have been masked or that the current version of the package was built for a different version of R. These messages are not usually a problem but are still important to note.\n\nTry to run the following code. Can you work out what the error means?\n\nlibrary(ggplot)\n\n\nThe above code throws an error because you have asked for a library that doesn’t exist. Remember that R is fickle and case sensitive and many of your errors will come from small typos in the names of functions or objects. Here, for example, we wanted to load the package ggplot2 but wrote ggplot instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nMost of the time, you’ll need to load a number of packages for your script and it is recommended to have a section at the start of your code that loads everything you’ll need in one place:\n\n# Packages ----------------------------\nlibrary(tidyverse)   # data manipulation\nlibrary(lubridate)   # date manipulation\n\nThis practice makes it easy to tell which packages need to be installed to run a script.\n\n\n\nUse comments to create a “Packages” section to your script.\n\n\n\nUpdating Packages\nR has a very active community of developers and it’s pretty common for packages to be updated from time to time as their owners add in new functions and fix existing bugs. In order to update the packages in your library, you can go into the Packages tab of the bottom right panel and click Update. Don’t forget that you’ll need to be connected to the internet during this process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nSometimes packages are updated in a way that might remove or change a function that you used in some of your scripts, causing your code to no longer work. Don’t panic if this happens. The best practice is to adapt your code, although in the worst case scenario you can forcibly install an old version of a package. This is however out of the scope of this session."

    "section": "Data Importation",
    "text": "Data Importation\n\nUnderstanding File Paths\nTo open a file in R you need to provide a file path. A file path is simply a longer name for a file, that includes not only its name but also its location on your computer. There are several ways of defining these paths, including absolute and relative paths.\n\nAbsolute Paths\nAbsolute paths are specific to your computer and go all the way up to the level of your hard drive. For example, an absolute path may look something like this: D:/OneDrive - MSF/Documents/monitoring/cholera/fancy_project/data/raw/example_linelist.xlsx. Clearly, this path will only work on one specific computer.\nThe use of hard coded absolute paths is strongly discouraged as it makes your code inflexible and prone to break: the paths need to be updated every time your code is shared or the project folder is moved on your computer.\n\n\nRelative Paths\nRelative paths are defined relatively to your current working directory. For example, keeping in mind that our handy .Rproj file set our working directory to the root of our project folder, we could create a relative path that looked like data/raw/example_linelist.xlsx. This means that as long as we maintain the internal structure of our project folder and have an .Rproj file, our code would theoretically run on multiple computers.\n\n\nRobust Paths with the here() function\nThe {here} package has a here() function that really helps defining paths. It has two advantages:\n\nWhen used with RStudio projects, you can give it only the part of the path within the project, (the relative path in other words), and the function uses it to create the absolute path dynamically.\nIt does so using the separator adapted to you operating system, whether it’s /, \\, or //\n\n\nlibrary(here)\nhere(\"data\", \"raw\", \"example_linelist.xlsx\")\n\n[1] \"C:/Users/M-MOUSSET/AppData/Local/Temp/RtmpSODdFu/file496824a56aca/data/raw/example_linelist.xlsx\"\n\n\nSee how we only defined the relative path and the function created an absolute path. This way of defining the path will work on your colleagues computer, even if they run on another operating system, as long as you both respect the internal structure of the working directory.\nWe strongly encourage you to use here() whenever you need to create a file path.\n\nRun the above code in the console. What file path does here(\"data\", \"raw\") give you?\n\n\nUsing here(), create a complete file path for the file Moissalla-measles-linelist-EN.xlsx. Keep this path around, we will use it soon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nhere() simply creates a file path, it doesn’t actually check if a file exists on your computer: if the file is absent or there is a typo in your code, the command will yield an error when the path is used. If you would like to use a function to check if a file exists, check out the file.exists() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWe will often want to source multiple data files in a single project. To make that process easier, it can be helpful to create a section at the start of the script, after loading the packages to define paths and store them in variables.\n\n\n\n\n\nImport function\nIn R different file formats are often imported using different, often specialized functions. This can be tedious as it requires you to memorize and load a large number of functions just to get your data imported. To avoid this problem, we recommend that you use the import() function from the package {rio}. This function is able to open a large variety of files (including Excel, csv, Stata, and many others) by recognizing the file extension of your data and calling a relevant specialized function from another package so that you don’t have to.\nBecause import() is actually just calling other functions in the background, it is possible that it will need different arguments depending on the type of file you want to load.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTo see the full list of all the file types you can load (and save!) with rio, check out the list of supported formats on their website. In the rest of the lesson we will focus on importing data from Excel .xlsx files.\n\n\n\nImporting from the First Sheet\nIn general, the usage of import() is pretty simple, at minima you need to pass the path of the file to the file argument\n\nimport(file = here(\"data\", \"raw\", \"example_linelist.xlsx\"))\n\nNotice that we have nested the command here() inside the import() command. Nesting functions is absolutely allowed in R and is something you will do all the time. When functions are nested, R will evaluate them in the order of the innermost function (in this case here()) to the outermost (in this case import()). In this way, the output of here() is being used as the input of import().\n\nImport the file Moissalla-measles-linelist-EN.xlsx that is in your raw data subfolder into R using here() and import().\n\nIf your import worked correctly, R will print the data into the console but not save it into the environment because we have not assigned them to an object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou may not want to have R print very large datasets into the console and assign them directly to an object.\n\n\n\nReimport your data but this time save it to an object called df_linelist.\n\n\n\nImporting Data from Any Sheet\nAs you just saw, R selects the first sheet by default. It is however possible to pass the number (or name) of a specific worksheet in your Excel data to import() using the argument which:\n\nimport(file = here(\"data\", \"raw\", \"example_linelist.xlsx\"),\n       which = 2)  # imports the second sheet\n\nNote that the which argument is specific to the file types that have multiple sheets, such as Excel or .Rdata files. If you try to use it on a .csv file the argument will be ignored."

The natural next step is to inspect this dataset, to check that the import went well, get to know it a bit better, and assess if it requires any cleaning before analysis.\nWe can start by taking a quick look at the first few lines of the dataframe using the function head(). This function takes a dataframe as its first argument and optionally accepts a second argument n indicating the number of lines we would like to see.\n\nhead(df_linelist, n = 10) # Inspect 10 first lines\n\n\nUse head() to examine the 12 first lines of df_linelist.\n\nWe can also check out our data by looking at the Environment tab of the top-right panel.

Then click on the name of the dataset to open it in the viewer.\n\nThe data viewer displays dataframes as tables and is a convenient way to quickly look at your data. You can even sort and filter your data in the “View”, though be aware that these actions will not make any changes to the actual object df_linelist.

    "text": "RStudio and R\nR is a functional programming language that can be used to clean and manipulate data, run analyses (especially statistical ones), visualize results, and much more.\nRStudio is a piece of software that provides a user-friendly interface for R (also called an IDE, for Integrated Development Environment). While using a graphical interface isn’t required, it is strongly recommended for beginners.\n\nGetting Started with RStudio\nLet’s get started!\n\nOpen RStudio using the start menu or desktop shortcut; if RStudio is already open, please close it and open it again.\n\nYou should see an interface that looks something like this:\n\n\n\nView of the Rstudio IDE interface at opening\n\n\n\nInspect the RStudio interface.\n\nYou will have either three or four panels, including:\n\nUpper Right Corner\nTo the upper right there will be a panel with several tabs. Many of these are beyond the scope of this course, but we will use the following two tabs during the course:\n\nEnvironment. A list of the objects saved by the user in the current session. Because you’ve just started a new session, your environment should be empty.\nHistory. A record of all the commands you have executed during the current session.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can think of an R session like you would think of starting up a computer. Whenever a session starts, everything is blank and ready for computation in the same way that there aren’t any programs open when you first turn on your computer. In general, we encourage you to stop and start your R sessions regularly, you may just find that turning it off an on again will fix some of your bugs.\n\n\n\n\nBottom Right Corner\nTo the bottom right there will be another multi tab panel, including:\n\nFiles. A file explorer for the working directory, which is the folder location where R is currently working.\nPlots. A location where RStudio will display static visualizations; this tab should be empty for the moment.\nPackages. A list of all the R packages installed on your computer. Packages are collections of functions that help extend the functionality of R, and we will discuss them in greater detail in the next lesson.\nHelp. A place to read help pages and documentation for functions and packages.\nViewer. A location where RStudio will display html outputs such as tables, interactive widgets, or even full on dashboards.\n\n\n\nLeft Side\n\nTo the left (or bottom left if you have four panels) you should see the console, where R itself is run.\nTo the top left (if you have four panels) will be any open scripts.\n\nIn the next two sections, let’s talk about the console and scripts in more detail.\n\n\n\nThe Console\nThe console is where R itself is run.\nWhenever you open a new session, R will start by printing a bit of information about your set up, such as your R version number. Below this there should be a line containing the &gt; symbol and a blinking cursor. To run a command in R, you simply need to type it in after this &gt; and press Enter. R will then process your code and print the result (if there is one). A new &gt; line will then appear ready for the next command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIf the last line shown in the console starts with a + instead of a &gt; that means the console is not ready for a new command either because it is still processing a previous one or because it received a bit of incomplete code. If at any point you would like to cancel an ongoing or incomplete command, press Esc.\n\n\n\nRun the following commands in the console one line at a time and observe the output.\n\n5 + 90\n\n6 * 171\n\n189 / 36.6\n\n92^3\n\n(12 + 9)^4 / 1000\n\nNow, run the following command. Note that the final ) is missing, making the command incomplete. What happens when you do this?\n\n3 / (2 + 97\n\n\nYou may have noticed in the above examples that our code includes a lot of spaces between characters. This is not by accident. It is considered best practice to include spaces around most operators, such as +, -, *, /, &lt;, &gt;, =, and &lt;-. Not only do these spaces make your code easier for other people to read and understand, in some (rare) cases they may even be necessary to avoid errors. That said, do be aware that there are a small number of operators that should not be surrounded by spaces, such as ^, . and :.\n\n1+29+4.8/3*3           # BAD\n1 + 29 + 4.8 / 3 * 3   # GOOD\n\n1 ^ 2 # BAD\n1^2   # GOOD\n\nWe can also run functions in the console. We will discuss functions in more depth later in this lesson, but meanwhile know that the idea of functions in R is very similar to the one in Excel, where you no doubt are familiar with functions such as SUM or MEAN.\n\nRun the following commands in the console (one line at a time).\n\n# Find the minimum value\nmin(5, 10)\nmin(1, 8, 56, 0.3)\n\n# Find the maximum value\nmax(568, 258, 314)\n\n\n\n\nScripts\nScripts are text files that contain a series of commands for a particular programming language. The extension of the file indicates which language the commands were written in, and we will be using .R. Scripts allow us to create code that can be reused, shared, and even automated.\n\nWriting Your First Script\n\n\n\nSteps to create a new script in the RStudio IDE\n\n\nTo create a new script, follow the menu File &gt; New File &gt; R Script. Alternatively, you can click on the small green + sign just below the File menu or use the keyboard shortcut CTRL+SHIFT+N. This new and unsaved script will appear as a blank document in the top left panel.\nTo save your script, either use the menu File &gt; Save As or the keyboard shortcut CTRL+S.\n\nCreate and save a new script called discovery.R. Don’t forget to include the .R extension. For now, you can save it on your Desktop or any convenient location, but we will talk more about organizing your scripts in the next session.\n\n\n\nExecuting Code from a Script\nTo run code from a script simply place your cursor on the line you wish to run (or select multiple lines) and do one of the following:\n\nClick the Run icon at the top right of the script panel\nUse the shortcut CTRL+Enter (cursor will move to the next line afterwards)\nUse the shortcut ALT+Enter (cursor will stay on the current line afterwards)\n\n\nCopy the code you ran in the previous exercises into your script and run it using each of the above methods.\nFrom now on, you will write your code in your script and execute it from there, unless told otherwise in the instructions.\n\n\n\nComments\nIn R, any text prefaced by a # (until the end of a line) is called a comment. R does not consider comments to be code and will ignore them whenever you run your scripts. This makes comments an excellent way to document your code.\n\n# This is a comment\n\n2 + 3  # This is also a comment\n\nIt is helpful to future you and others to start your scripts with a few commented lines providing some information about the file.\n\n#### IMPORT & PREPARE DATA ####\n# Author :  Mathilde Mousset\n# Creation Date : 23/11/2024\n# Last Update : 30/11/2024\n# Description : Import and clean measles surveillance data from Moissala\n\n\nAdd some comments to the top of your script describing it.\n\nComments are also a handy way to split longer scripts into thematic sections, such as “Data Importation”, “Analysis”, “Visualization”, etc. For example:\n\n# NAME OF SECTION 1 -----------------------------------------------             \n\n# NAME OF SECTION 2 -----------------------------------------------             \n\n\nUse comments to create sections in your script that correspond to the main sections in this tutorial.\n\nFinally, comments allow us write helpful notes for our colleagues (and our future selves) that can help them understand the code and why we wrote it the way we did. The general guidance is to focus on comments that explain the “why” rather than the “what”. This is because the “what” of well written code should be relatively self explanatory.\nThis comment, for example, is completely superfluous:\n\n1 + 3  # Code to add one to three\n\nBy comparison, here are a few use cases that would warrant comments:\n\nYou define a constant, say a seroprevalence threshold value. You may want to add a comment providing the reference for where the value comes from.\nYour code contains a value or file name that needs to be updated every week. You should indicate this with a comment to ensure that anyone else using the code is aware.\nYou use a rare command or package that your colleague may not know or may find counter intuitive. You can use a comment to explain the rational behind that decision.\n\nThat being said, you are learning, and the scripts you are writing during this course are your notes, so feel free to us as many comments (of the “what” and “why” sort) as you need. You will naturally write less comments in the future, when some of the things that seem alien now become natural.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can comment a selected line with the shortcut CTRL+SHIFT+C.\nYou can add a first level section with CTRL+SHIFT+R.\n\n\n\nAdd some comments to describe the code that you’ve written thus far in your script."

    "text": "Data Types\nR has several different data types. The ones we will see most often in this course include:\n\nnumeric\nstring (text)\nboolean (TRUE / FALSE)\ndate\nfactor\n\n\nNumerics\nThe numeric type includes both integers and doubles (numbers that include a decimal) and can be created by simply writing the “naked” value into your script or console.\n\n\nStrings\nStrings are the R version of text and can be created by surrounding text with single or double quotation marks, for example \"district\" or 'cases' (double quotations are typically considered best practice).\n\nCompare the output in the console for the following commands:\n\n28         # numeric\n\"28\"       # text\n28 + \"28\"  # produces an error\n\n\nThe last command above will give an error because we cannot perform arithmetic operations that combine text and numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nR is case sensitive, meaning that the string \"ABC\" is not the same as \"abc\".\n\n\n\nIf you would like to create a string that contains a quotation mark the best practice is to escape the character by putting a \\ in front of it, ie: \"She said \\\"Hello\\\" then left\" or 'it\\'s a beautiful day'. Equivalently, if you used a double quotation to create the string you can use single quotes inside of it freely (ie: \"it's a beautiful day\") and vice versa (i.e.: 'She said \"Hello\" then left').\n\n\n\nBoolean (Logical)\nThe boolean (or “logical”) type stores true/false values and is created by writing either TRUE or FALSE without quotation marks.\nInternally, R thinks of TRUE and FALSE as being a special version of 1 and 0 respectively, and boolean values can be easily translated to these numeric equivalents for arithmetic operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou may find people using T or F but this is discouraged as T and F can also be used as object or variable names. TRUE and FALSE, however, are protected in R, meaning they cannot be reassigned to another value.\n\n\n\n\nDetermining the Type of an Object\nThere are several functions to determine the type of an object (often called the class of the object in R).\n\nType the following commands in your script and run them:\n\n# Get the Type of an Object\nclass(28)  \nclass(\"Mandoul\")\n\n# Test the Type of an Object\nis.numeric(28)\nis.numeric(\"Mandoul\")\nis.character(\"Mandoul\")\n\nis.numeric(TRUE)\nis.character(TRUE)\nis.logical(FALSE)"

    "section": "Creating an Object",
    "text": "Creating an Object\nIn R, pretty much everything is an object, including functions, scalar values, and other more complex data structures. Before introducing these structures, let’s take an important detour to discuss how objects are saved into your environment.\nOften, we will want to reuse the same values or data throughout a script and it is therefore very useful to store them as objects in our environment. To do this we use the assignment operator, &lt;-.\n\nLook at the environment panel on the top right, verifying that it is empty, then type the following command in your script and run it to save a variable called cases into your environment.\n\ncases &lt;- 28\n\nLook at the environment again. Is it still empty?\n\nIf you’d like to access the value of your new object, cases, you simply need to execute its name.\n\ncases\n\n[1] 28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe reason we need to wrap strings in quotation marks is actually to allow R to differentiate between strings (\"cases\" and object names cases).\n\n\nOnce created, objects can be used in other commands:\n\ncases + 5\n\n[1] 33\n\n\n\nFrom your script, create an object called region that contains the value \"Mandoul\". Do you see it in your environment?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nDon’t forget that we should always surround &lt;- with spaces to improve readability and avoid errors.\n\nx&lt;-3     # BAD\nx &lt;- 3   # GOOD\n\n\n\n\nUpdating an Object\nWe often want to update the value stored in an object. To do this, we simply assign a new value with the same syntax we used to create it in the first place:\n\ncases &lt;- 32\n\n\nUpdate the value of region to \"Moyen Chari\".\n\n\n\nObject Names\nWhen naming your objects, there are a few (relatively) hard rules:\n\nDon’t start with a number\nDon’t use spaces (use a _ instead)\nDon’t use protected values (like TRUE and FALSE) or function names (like mean)\nDon’t use capital letters\n\nBeyond these hard rules, there are also more subjective best practices and personal styles. In general aim for names that are short and descriptive:\n\na &lt;- 19                             # BAD (not informative)\nage_du_patient_a_l_admission &lt;- 19  # BAD (too long)\nage &lt;- 19                           # GOOD\n\nGiving your objects clear and informative names helps to make your code readable, making it easy for others to understand without the need for checking the data dictionary every two seconds."

    "section": "Data Structures",
    "text": "Data Structures\nUp until now we have looked only at simple objects that store single values, let’s now turn our focus to more complex structures that can store entire datasets.\n\nVectors\nWe can collect multiple values (such as numerics or strings) into a single object, called a vector.\nTechnically, there are several types of vectors, for example:\n\nSimple vectors (or atomic vectors) can only contain one type of values. For example, a numeric vector 2, 4, 6 or a string vector \"Mandoul\", \"Moyen Chari\".\nRecursive vectors (usually called lists) are far more complex and can contain multiple dimensions and types of data. We will not learn about them in this lesson.\n\nThis course will not go into detail on the more abstract concepts behind these structures and instead focus only on those you will encounter most often in your daily work.\n\nSimple Vectors\nSimple vectors can contain one or more values of a single data type, they thus have two key properties: length and type. For the purpose of this class, we will use the terms “simple vector” and “vector” interchangeably (as is typical in the R community).\nYou’ve technically already created your first simple vector when you built cases and region. These were simply vectors with a length of one. To create a vector with more than one value, we will use the function c() (mnemonic):\n\ncases &lt;- c(2, 5, 8, 0, 4)\n\n\nUpdate cases with the above values and update region to create a string vector containing the values: Mandoul, Moyen-Chari, Logone Oriental, Tibesti, and Logone Occidental.\n\nWe can now use functions on the objects we have created:\n\nmean(cases)      # calculate the mean value of the cases vector\n\n[1] 3.8\n\ntoupper(region)  # convert all the values in region to upper case\n\n[1] \"MANDOUL\"           \"MOYEN-CHARI\"       \"LOGONE ORIENTAL\"  \n[4] \"TIBESTI\"           \"LOGONE OCCIDENTAL\"\n\n\n\nLet’s use some functions! Try to write code that does the following:\n\nCalculate the sum of cases using the function sum()\nConvert the text in region to lowercase using the function tolower()\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessing the Values of a Vector\nIt is possible to access the value of a vector using square brackets containing the index (position) of the desired value, ie: [3] or [189].\n\ncases[2]   # 2nd value of cases\n\n[1] 5\n\ncases[10]  # 10th value of cases\n\n[1] NA\n\n\nOoops it does not exist! We will come back to what this NA means in the Missing Values section.\nWe can also access a range of values, just as we might do in Excel. To create a range we use the : operator to separate the desired minimum and maximum index:\n\ncases[2:4]  # 2nd to 4th values of cases\n\n[1] 5 8 0\n\n\n\nGet the 3rd value of region.\nWrite code to access the values “Mandoul” and “Moyen-Chari” in the vector region.\n\n\n\nData frames\nData frames are tabular structures / 2D tables with rows and columns. It is very similar to a “table” structure in Excel. As epidemiologists, this type of data structure is perhaps the most useful and you will likely use them on a daily basis, to store linelist data for example.\n\nCreating a data frame\nWe can create a data frame using the function data.frame():\n\ndata.frame(col1 = c(1, 4, 2, 9),\n           col2 = c(\"a bit of text\", \"some more text\", \"hello\", \"epidemiologists!\"))\n\n  col1             col2\n1    1    a bit of text\n2    4   some more text\n3    2            hello\n4    9 epidemiologists!\n\n\nSee how col1 was created from a numeric vector, and col2 from a vector of strings. Here we chose the names of the columns (col1 and col2), which is the normal way, but you can run the code without to see how R handles names by default.\n\nIn your script, create a data frame called data_cases that contains cases in one column and region in the other.\n\n\n\nExploring a data frame\ndata_cases should now appear in your environment. You can click on the blue circle with a white triangle in to see some additional information, or click on its name to open the object in the same pane as the scripts to view it.\n\n\n\nThe data_case data frame now appears in the Environment pane\n\n\nThere are several handy functions we can use to explore a data frame:\n\nRun the following commands and try to determine what type of information they are returning.\n\nstr(data_cases)     # STRucture of the object\ndim(data_cases)     # DIMension of the object\nnrow(data_cases)    # Number of ROWs\nncol(data_cases)    # Number of COLumns\nnames(data_cases)   # column NAMES\n\n\nLet’s practice a bit more! R comes with several built in data sets that can be accessed directly, including one called iris. It is convenient today as we have not learned to import data in R yet (don’t worry, we will work on linelist data from the second session then onwards).\nWe can see the first few lines of this data frame using the function head():\n\nhead(iris)\n\n  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species\n1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa\n2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa\n3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa\n4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa\n5          5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa\n6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa\n\n\n\nHow many rows and columns are there in iris? What are the names of its columns?\n\n\n\nAccessing Data in a data frame\nIn R, there are several methods for accessing the rows and/or columns of a data frame. In this introductory session we will focus on the [ ] syntax.\nWe use square brackets to access single values or ranges within our data frame. To do this we must give R both a row number (or range of rows) and column number/name (or range of columns), using the syntax [row, column].\n\ndata_cases[1, 2]          # the value of row one, column 2\n\n[1] \"Mandoul\"\n\ndata_cases[1, \"region\"]   # first value in the region column\n\n[1] \"Mandoul\"\n\n\nIf we want to access all of the rows (or columns) we can simple leave a space in the place of the number/name:\n\ndata_cases[1, ]           # values of all columns in row one\n\n  cases  region\n1     2 Mandoul\n\ndata_cases[2:4, ]         # values of all columns for rows 2 through 4\n\n  cases         region\n2     5       Sud Kivu\n3     8 Kasai oriental\n4     0          Kasai\n\ndata_cases[ , \"region\"]   # values of all rows for the region column\n\n[1] \"Mandoul\"        \"Sud Kivu\"       \"Kasai oriental\" \"Kasai\"         \n[5] \"Haut Katanga\"  \n\n\nWe can even select multiple non-consecutive indices by using a numeric vector:\n\ndata_cases[c(1, 3), ]  # lines 1 and 3 (all columns)\n\n  cases         region\n1     2        Mandoul\n3     8 Kasai oriental\n\n\nDo be careful, as the type of output returned when extracting data from a data frame can sometimes depend on the style of indexing used:\n\nstr(data_cases[1 , ])   # returns a data frame\n\n'data.frame':   1 obs. of  2 variables:\n $ cases : num 2\n $ region: chr \"Mandoul\"\n\nstr(data_cases[ , 1])   # returns a simple vector\n\n num [1:5] 2 5 8 0 4\n\n\nAnother syntaxt to extract the various columns of a data frame:\n\ndata_cases[2]           # returns the second column (as a data frame)\n\n          region\n1        Mandoul\n2       Sud Kivu\n3 Kasai oriental\n4          Kasai\n5   Haut Katanga\n\ndata_cases[\"region\"]    # returns the region column (as a data frame)\n\n          region\n1        Mandoul\n2       Sud Kivu\n3 Kasai oriental\n4          Kasai\n5   Haut Katanga\n\n\nNotice that these commands returned single-column data frames.\n\nWrite some code to:\n\nextract the third value in the region column of your data frame\n\nextract the second and third values of the cases column\n\ncalculate the sum of the cases column of your data frame"

NA is somewhat unique in R as it doesn’t per se have a fixed type, rather, it will take on the type of the values around it. For example, an NA in a numeric column will then take on the numeric type. We will discuss the idea of missing data in more depth in later sessions of the course."

    "section": "Functions",
    "text": "Functions\nFunctions are objects that contain commands (instead of values) that are run whenever the function is called. You are without doubt familiar with functions in Excel such as SUM or MEAN and the idea of functions in R is exactly the same.\nMost functions require some sort of input, such as a dataset or parameter. These inputs are called arguments and are normally named. For example, when we ran sum(cases), we provided the vector cases as the first (and only) argument to the function sum().\nOften, a function will have a combination of both required and optional arguments. The first argument of a function is almost always required and is typically a dataset. As an obligatory and rather obvious argument, most people omit its name when calling a function; ie: i.e. people will write mean(cases) instead of mean(x = cases). Optional arguments on the other hand are usually added using their name, i.e.: mean(x = cases, na.rm = TRUE).\nOptional arguments typically have default values and we only include them when we want to change their defaults (and thus change the default behavior of the function). For example, the na.rm argument of mean() determines whether R will ignore missing values when calculating a mean. The default state of the na.rm argument is FALSE, so by default, the mean performed on data with missing values will always return NA as the result:\n\nmean(c(1, 3, NA))\n\n[1] NA\n\n\nThis is true for many arithmetic operations in R. If we want R to calculate the mean on whatever data is available (and ignore the missing values) we need to explicitly set na.rm = TRUE:\n\nmean(c(1, 3, NA), na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nNotice that arguments are separated by commas. These commas should always be followed by a space and whenever a named argument is used the = should be surrounded by spaces:\n\nmean(cases,na.rm=TRUE)     # BAD\nmean(cases, na.rm = TRUE)  # GOOD\n\nAs you work with increasingly complex functions, you may start to have a lot of arguments. For readability, it is typically recommended to split each argument onto its own line:\n\nmean(cases, \n     na.rm = TRUE) \n\n\n\nWhat happens if we put the arguments in the wrong order? If you provided the name of the arguments in you command, the function will still work exactly as expected. That being said, doing this would make your code harder to read and we encourage you to stick with a standard order of putting obligatory arguments like data first.\n\n# technically functional but hard to read:\nmean(na.rm = TRUE,  \n     x = cases) \n\n# better:\nmean(cases,         \n     na.rm = TRUE)\n\nOf course, if you mess up the ordering of arguments and didn’t include their names your code will not work as expected, or even throw an error:\n\nmean(TRUE, cases)   # not what you expect"

For example, renaming columns will use the function rename().\nIn today’s session we will look at the “data manipulation verb”, ie the function, needed for each of the above tasks as well as how to chain them all together into an efficient data pipeline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou may have noticed that we asked you to load a package called {tidyverse} rather than {dplyr} in the setup.

This is where a function like select() comes in handy.\nHere is the basic syntax, note that this is pseudo-code and isn’t something you are intended to run yourself.\n\n# DO NOT RUN (PSEUDO-CODE)\nselect(df_raw, first_column_to_keep, second_column_to_keep)\n\nHere we see that the first argument is our dataset and each subsequent argument is the name of a column that we would like to keep. In the tidyverse, variables (ie column names) don’t need to be put into quotation marks. So for example, if we want to select the columns id, sex, and age we can use the following:\n\nselect(df_raw, id, sex, age)\n\n\nUse select() to select the following variables in your dataset: id, sex, age, sub_prefecture, date_onset, and outcome. The head of your output should look something like this:\n\n\n  id   sex age date_onset   outcome\n1  1 femme  36 2022-08-13 recovered\n2  2     f   5 2022-08-18      &lt;NA&gt;\n3  3     f 156 2022-08-17 recovered\n4  6 homme   8 2022-08-22 recovered\n5  7     m   7 2022-08-30 recovered\n6 10     m   4 2022-08-30 recovered\n\n\n Take a look at this output and then at df_raw. We can see that df_raw still contains all of the columns, which is what we want. But can you tell why it didn’t change?\n\nOften, we want to keep most of the variables in our dataset and only remove one or two. We can use the above syntax to do this, but it can become pretty tedious to write out every column name. In these cases, instead of telling select what to **keep**, we can use a subtraction sign (-) to tell it what to **remove**. For example, if we wanted to remove thevillage_commune` column from our dataframe we can use the following:\n\nselect(df_raw, -village_commune)\n\nWay easier!\n\nUse the - syntax in select() to select all of the columns in df_raw except: full_name and age_unit from your dataset.\n\n\n\nRenaming Columns\nAnother common issue when we get new datasets is that the variable names are inconvenient. In those cases, rename() can work wonders. Here’s the basic syntax:\n\n# DO NOT RUN (PSEUDO CODE)\nrename(df,\n       new_column_name = old_column_name,\n       another_new_name = another_old_name)\n\nAs in the case of select(), and indeed in essentially all {dplyr} verbs, the first argument is our daframe. Then each subsequent argument is a statement of new_column_name = old_column_name telling R which columns to rename and the new names that we want to use, with each pair given its own line to improve readability. If we wanted to change village_commune to simply be village, for example, we can write:\n\nrename(df_raw,\n       village = village_commune)\n\n\nUse rename() on df_raw to change the columns sub_prefecture, village_commune, and health_facility_name to be prefecture, village, and facility respectively.\n\nIn the above exercise it may have been difficult to check if the output looked correct because R would have printed out the full data frame. In these cases it can be helpful to create a temporary object just to check if everything looks alright. You can call this object whatever you want, but a common name is tmp.\n\nRepeat the last exercise but this time assign the output to an object called tmp and use names() to check that the column names changed as you expected. The output of names() should give you something like this:\n\n\n [1] \"id\"                \"full_name\"         \"sex\"              \n [4] \"age\"               \"age_unit\"          \"region\"           \n [7] \"prefecture\"        \"village\"           \"date_onset\"       \n[10] \"date_consultation\" \"hospitalisation\"   \"date_admission\"   \n[13] \"facility\"          \"malaria_rdt\"       \"fever\"            \n[16] \"rash\"              \"cough\"             \"red_eye\"          \n[19] \"pneumonia\"         \"encephalitis\"      \"muac\"             \n[22] \"vacc_status\"       \"vacc_doses\"        \"outcome\"          \n[25] \"date_outcome\"     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nTemporary objects, like the tmp data frame you just created are just that: temporary. They are usually used to test if something has worked and designed to be overwritten each time you need to test something else. As such, you should not use these temporary objects as the input for other parts of your code. If you want to make a data frame that will be reused, such as a clean version of df_raw, this should be done using an object with a proper name like df or df_clean.\n\n\n\n\nChanging and Adding Columns\nSo now we know how to select and rename columns, but how do we modify them? This is where mutate() comes into play. This function can be used both to add new columns and to change existing ones.\nLet’s start with the basic mutate() syntax needed to add a new column:\n\n# DO NOT RUN (PSEUDO-CODE)\nmutate(df,\n       new_column = action(existing_column),\n       another_new_column = another_action(another_existing_column))\n\nIn the above code, we are creating a new column (new_column) by performing some sort of action (action()) on an existing column in the dataframe (existing_column). This action could be anything, it could use a function or be a simple arithmetic operation and can use one or more columns. For example, if we wanted to create a new column expressing MUAC in cm we could use the following:\n\nmutate(df_raw,\n       muac_cm = muac / 100)\n\n\nUse mutate() to create a new column called age_years that expresses age in years rather than months. The head of your new age_years column should look like this:\n\n\n   age_years\n1  3.0000000\n2  0.4166667\n3 13.0000000\n4  0.6666667\n5  0.5833333\n6  0.3333333\n\n\n\nGreat! But what if instead of creating a new column we instead wanted to change an existing one? You just need to use the existing column name on the left side of the = instead of giving a new column name. For example, in the above MUAC code we would write:\n\nmutate(df_raw,\n       muac = muac / 100)\n\nWe might want to keep age in months as well as years, so we won’t reassign that column. But there are some other columns that could stand to be changed. There are a lot of reasons we might want to change a column, two of the most common ones are:\n\nThe format of a string needs changing\nThe data type of a column is incorrect\n\nOur dataset has both of these problems. For example, while it isn’t per se a problem that region and sub_prefecture are in all capitals, it also isn’t particularly nice. To fix this, we can use another function from the {tidyverse}, this time from a package called {stringr} to make these columns title case:\n\nmutate(df_raw,\n       region = str_to_title(region),\n       sub_prefecture = str_to_title(sub_prefecture))\n\n\nUse mutate() to update the format of malaria_rdt and outcome to use title case. The head of these two columns should now look something like this:\n\n\n  malaria_rdt   outcome\n1    Negative Recovered\n2    Negative      &lt;NA&gt;\n3    Negative Recovered\n4    Negative Recovered\n5    Negative Recovered\n6    Negative Recovered\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNotice that we didn’t need to load {stringr} to do the above exercise. That’s because, like {dplyr} this package is loaded when we load the {tidyverse}.\n\n\nThat’s nicer. Now let’s consider the second issue, having variables with the wrong type.\n\nTake a look at the data type of your columns, do any of them look strange?  Hint. str() may be useful here.\n\nMost of the columns look ok, but it seems theres something strange with the dates. Some of them are character type and others are something called POSIXct. We would much rather have all of these columns use the simple Date type.\nTo convert to dates, we are going to call on yet another package from the the tidyverse, {lubridate}. In particular, we are going to use the function ymd(). For example:\n\nmutate(df_raw,\n       date_outcome = ymd(date_outcome))\n\n\nUse mutate() and ymd() to modify date_onset and date_admission to be Date type. Use a temporary data frame tmp to check that your code is doing what you want it to.\n\n\n\nRemoving Duplicates\nOk great! We know how to select, rename, and modify our data. Another task we will often need to do is removing duplicate entries. Fortunately this one is easily done using the function distinct(), which has the following basic syntax:\n\n# DO NOT RUN (PSEUDO-CODE)\ndistinct(df)\n\nNotice that distinct only needs one argument by default, the dataset itself. This will look for and remove any duplicate observations in the data frame. There are some fancier ways of using distinct() that will look for duplication on certain variables only, but that’s outside of the scope of today’s session.\n\nUse distinct() to create a temporary data frame, tmp, that contains all the unique observations in df_raw. Compare the number of rows in tmp to that of df_raw. Did we have any duplicates?"

    "text": "The Pipe Operator\nSo it looks like we have actually done quite a bit of cleaning while learning the core {dplyr} verbs. We should probably try to put some of the above steps together to start building a basic data cleaning pipeline. So far we haven’t been saving any of our changes, except perhaps to a temporary data frame. It would be nice to keep them in a new clean df object.\nFor example, if we want to effect the column renaming we did above to a reusable object we might write something like this:\n\ndf &lt;- rename(df_raw, \n             prefecture = sub_prefecture,\n             village = village_commune,\n             facility = health_facility_name)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIn general, it’s good practice to keep a raw version of your dataset, here df_raw, that remains unmodified in your code. This is so that you always have it available in your environment as a reference and is always available at the start of your cleaning pipeline to improve reproducibility.\n\n\nNow we have a new object, df that we can do more operations on. Brilliant. For example, if we now wanted to select everything except for full_name we could update the above code like this:\n\n# Step 1: Rename Variables\ndf &lt;- rename(df_raw, \n             prefecture = sub_prefecture,\n             village = village_commune,\n             facility = health_facility_name)\n\n# Step 2: Select Variables to Keep\ndf &lt;- select(df,\n             -full_name)\n\nNotice that in this second step we are using df as the input of select() rather than df_raw because we want to continue working on our modified version of the data. Let’s say now we want to add a column of age in years:\n\n# Step 1: Rename Variables\ndf &lt;- rename(df_raw, \n             prefecture = sub_prefecture,\n             village = village_commune,\n             facility = health_facility_name)\n\n# Step 2: Select Variables to Keep\ndf &lt;- select(df,\n             -full_name)\n\n# Step 3: Add Age in Years\ndf &lt;- mutate(df,\n             age_years = age / 12)\n\nHm, ok well this is working but it is starting to get repetitive. With each step we are reusing the output of the last step and then updating the same data frame, df. It would be better if these actions could be chained together in a simpler way.\nThis is exactly what the pipe operator, |&gt; is for! The pipe has the following basic syntax:\n\n# DO NOT RUN (PSEUDO-CODE)\ninput |&gt; action()\n\nHere the input on the left side (input) is “piped into” the action on the right side (action()). So for example instead of writing:\n\nselect(df_raw, id, sex)\n\nWe could instead write:\n\ndf_raw |&gt;\n  select(id, sex)\n\n\nTry out the above code to see if it works.\n\nThis can be used to chain multiple actions together and you will often see tidyverse style code that uses pipes in the following way:\n\n# DO NOT RUN (PSEUDO-CODE)\ndf &lt;- df_raw |&gt;\n  first_action() |&gt;\n  second_action() |&gt;\n  third_action()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nNotice that here each action in the pipe is given its own line. This is considered good practice as it makes your code easier to read and understand.\n\n\nSo, if we wanted to chain the example actions we saw above into a single pipe, we might write something like this:\n\ndf &lt;- df_raw |&gt;\n  rename(prefecture = sub_prefecture,\n         village = village_commune,\n         facility = health_facility_name) |&gt;\n  select(-full_name) |&gt;\n  mutate(age_years = age / 12)\n\nThat’s a lot easier than reassigning df after each step!\n\nLet’s see if we can put together what we learned above into a single pipeline! Use the pipe operator |&gt;, select(), rename(), mutate(), str_to_title(), ymd(), and distinct() to perform the following actions on df_raw and assign the output to a new data frame called df:\n\nRemove the variables full_name and age_unit\nRename the following variables:\n\nage becomes age_months\nsub_prefecture becomes prefecture\nvillage_commune becomes village\nhealth_facility_name becomes facility\n\nAdd a variable age_years with patient age in years\nUpdate region and prefecture to use title case\nUpdate all date columns to use Date type\nRemove any duplicate observations\n\nThe head of your final data should look something like this:\n\n\n  id   sex age_months  region prefecture        village date_onset\n1  1 femme         36 Mandoul   Moissala Sangana Koïtan 2022-08-13\n2  2     f          5 Mandoul   Moissala      Mousdan 1 2022-08-18\n3  3     f        156 Mandoul   Moissala     Djaroua Ii 2022-08-17\n4  6 homme          8 Mandoul   Moissala     Monakoumba 2022-08-22\n5  7     m          7 Mandoul   Moissala      Tétindaya 2022-08-30\n6 10     m          4 Mandoul   Moissala      Danamadja 2022-08-30\n  date_consultation hospitalisation date_admission\n1        2022-08-14             yes     2022-08-14\n2        2022-08-25             yes     2022-08-25\n3        2022-08-20            &lt;NA&gt;           &lt;NA&gt;\n4        2022-08-25              no           &lt;NA&gt;\n5        2022-09-02              no           &lt;NA&gt;\n6        2022-09-02             yes     2022-09-02\n                         facility malaria_rdt fever rash cough red_eye\n1 Hôpital du District de Moissala    negative    No &lt;NA&gt;   Yes      No\n2 Hôpital du District de Moissala    negative    No   No   Yes      No\n3                      CS Silambi    negative   Yes &lt;NA&gt;    No      No\n4 Hôpital du District de Moissala    negative    No   No    No    &lt;NA&gt;\n5                      CS Silambi    negative  &lt;NA&gt;   No   Yes     Yes\n6                    Moissala Est    negative   Yes   No    No    &lt;NA&gt;\n  pneumonia encephalitis muac vacc_status vacc_doses   outcome date_outcome\n1        No           No  244        &lt;NA&gt;       &lt;NA&gt; recovered   2022-08-18\n2      &lt;NA&gt;           No  232          No       &lt;NA&gt;      &lt;NA&gt;   2022-08-28\n3        No         &lt;NA&gt;  123  Yes - oral       &lt;NA&gt; recovered         &lt;NA&gt;\n4        No           No  210          No       &lt;NA&gt; recovered         &lt;NA&gt;\n5        No           No   80          No       &lt;NA&gt; recovered         &lt;NA&gt;\n6        No           No  220          No       &lt;NA&gt; recovered   2022-09-03\n   age_years\n1  3.0000000\n2  0.4166667\n3 13.0000000\n4  0.6666667\n5  0.5833333\n6  0.3333333\n\n\nHint.

That looks like a great start at a data cleaning pipeline. Keep this code handy, you will use it in the next session where we will look at another common part of data cleaning: recoding."

How can you also call the proportion of patients who died? Are you happy with this calculation?\n\nThe proportion of cases that died is also referred to as the Case Fatality Ratio (CFR). To precisely calculate the CFR we need to make sure that the denominator only includes patient for whom we are sure of their outcome (ie we need to remove all cases with NA or left aginst medical advice).\nRemember that we can do this using filter(). To filter for missing values (NA) in a variable we can use the small function is.na(outcome). Adding a ! in front will do the opposite: removing missing values from outcome:\n\ndf_linelist |&gt;\n  filter(\n    outcome != \"left against medical advice\", \n    !is.na(outcome)\n  ) |&gt;\n  count(outcome)\n\n\nWhich other conditionnal statement could you use in filter() to obtain the same results\n\nNow that we have removed the patients with unknown outcomes, we can add this before creating our frequency table to get the right CFR.\n\nUsing your filter, update your code to summarize the observed number of patients who survived and died as well as the CFR (proportion who died).

It allows us to calculate summary statistics on a dataset, and the syntax is similar to that of mutate():\n\n# DO NOT RUN (PSEUDO-CODE)\ndf |&gt;\n  mutate(new_col = function_to_create(existing_col))\n\ndf |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    .by = grouping_variable,\n    new_col = summary_function(existing_col)\n  )\n\nConsider the following code, here we are summarizing the data to calculate the average age across all patients.\n\ndf_linelist |&gt;\n  summarize(mean_age = mean(age))\n\n  mean_age\n1 6.822047\n\n\nNotice that this code yields a single value for average age. No grouping variable was provided so summarize() returned one summary statistic for the whole dataset. To calculate the average age by a specific strata, we need to specify a grouping variable using the .by argument:\n\ndf_linelist |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    .by = sex,  # Make the summary (here, the mean) by sex\n    mean_age = mean(age)\n  )\n\n  sex mean_age\n1   f 6.773824\n2   m 6.869855\n\n\n\nTake a look at the above results. How would you interpret them?\n\nNow that we can use summarize() we can use it to calculate some proper summary statistics by sub-prefecture. Let’s start by calling an empty summarize() and grouping the data on sub_prefecture.\n\nRun the following code:\n\ndf_linelist |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    .by = sub_prefecture\n  )\n\nWhat happens when you run these lines?\n\n\nCounts\nWe first want to look at the number of cases in each sub_prefecture. This can be done using the helper function n():\n\ndf_linelist |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    .by = sub_prefecture,\n    n_patients = n() # Count stuffs\n  )\n\n\nOk now let’s build a summary table for each sub_prefecture. First start by replicating the above lines\n\n\n\nSummarizing Continuous Variables\nWe can then use the mean(), median(), min(), max() functions (and other) to produce summaries for continuous variables. For example the average age:\n\ndf_linelist |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    .by = sub_prefecture,\n    n_patients = n(),\n    mean_age = mean(age)\n  )\n\n\nAdd the minimum date of admission to your table for each of the sub_prefecture? Are you happy with the results?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nRemember that with the arithmetic functions such as mean(), median(), min(), max(), you need to explicitly tell R to remove NA.\n\n\n\n\nCounting with a Condition\nWe may also be interested in looking at the number of patients (rows) that fit a condition: the number of patients that were female. Counting by a logical condition can be done with the following syntax:\n\n# DO NOT RUN (PSEUDO-CODE)\nsummarize(\n  sum_category = sum(LOGIC_TEST, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\nThis sum allows us to count all the lines where our condition was met (returns TRUE). For example:\n\ndf_linelist |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    .by = sub_prefecture,\n    n_female = sum(sex == \"f\", na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\n\nAdd a variable to your table that counts the number of patients that have been hospitalized. (ie: rows that have yes in variable hospitalisation)\n\n\n\nOther Statistics\nSometimes we want to produce a more complicated statistic, for example the mean age of all hospitalized patients. Here the syntax is a bit different:\n\n# DO NOT RUN (PSEUDO-CODE)\ndf |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    mean_category = mean(col_to_use[LOGIC_TEST], na.rm = TRUE)\n    )\n\nHere, we have:\n\nStated what summary statistic we want to use (mean())\nIndicated which column we want to calculate that statistic on (col_to_use)\nCreated a condition of which observations in that column to use in the calculation ([LOGIC_TEST])\n\nTo give a concrete example, if we wanted to compute the mean of the age variable but only for hospitalized patients (ie: in rows where hospitalisation == \"yes\") we would write:\n\ndf_linelist |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    .by = sub_prefecture,\n    n_patients = n(),\n    mean_age_hosp = mean(age[hospitalisation == \"yes\"], na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\nThe use of a logical test in the example above is called logical indexing, where a condition is essentially being used to filter which observations you want to consider when performing a calculation. Logical indexing is very powerful but can also take some getting used to, so don’t worry too much if it isn’t perfectly clear at this stage.\n\nCan you use this syntax to calculate the mean age of female patients in your table?\n\nThat is looking great! We are starting to get a pretty exhaustive grouped summary table with a lot of useful information by sub_prefecture! An extra challenge for you:\n\nCHALLENGE: Could you add a variable to your table that counts the number of patients that died among the ones that are &lt; 6 months old.\n Hint. You want to count rows (so use sum()) that fill a specific condition for outcome (outcome == \"dead\"), but only when age_group == \"&lt; 6 months\"\n\n\n\nUse the Output\nFinally, remember that summarize() returns a dataframe that we can then further manipulate (eg: with filter() and mutate()).\n\nAdd a mutate() after producing your summary table to calculate:\n\nThe proportion of hospitalized patients per sub-prefecture\nThe proportion of female patients per sub-prefecture\n\n\nThe head of your final table should look like this:\n\n\n  sub_prefecture n_patients mean_age min_admission n_female n_hosp\n1       Moissala       1808 6.842920    2022-08-14      923    612\n2          Bouna       1376 6.555959    2023-01-11      669    412\n3       Bedjondo        534 7.073034    2023-06-09      251    184\n4       Bekourou        496 6.836694    2023-06-17      251    164\n5         Bedaya        435 7.098851    2023-07-04      209    147\n6         Koumra        253 7.106719    2023-08-14      138     84\n  mean_age_hosp mean_age_female n_death_u6m prop_female prop_hosp\n1      5.485294        6.748646          71   0.5105088 0.3384956\n2      5.665049        6.633782          61   0.4861919 0.2994186\n3      5.211957        6.948207          22   0.4700375 0.3445693\n4      6.042683        6.840637          25   0.5060484 0.3306452\n5      6.156463        7.105263          17   0.4804598 0.3379310\n6      6.261905        6.456522           7   0.5454545 0.3320158"
