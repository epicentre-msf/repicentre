Hey There
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to `{repicentre}`, an open source site developed by Epicentre to support folks learning R for humanitarian contexts. The site is composed of self paced tutorials and has two main options for learning:

1. **Linear.** Designed for people with zero prior experience in R, the linear course will walk you through core R concepts using a case study about measles in Chad. The course covers the following concepts:
    a. Data Structures and the RStudio Interface
    b. Data Importation
    c. Data Manipulation
    d. Data Cleaning
    e. Data Aggregation
    f. Data Visualization
2. **Choose Your Own Adventure.** If you have a bit more experience or if you are looking for a particular subject, feel free to explore the full range of tutorials. Tutorials are tagged with categories and designed to be self contained.
