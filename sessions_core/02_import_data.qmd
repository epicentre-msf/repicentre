## Objectives

- Create a RStudio Project 
- Set up an organized and well documented code 
- Install and load packages
- Write robust file paths   
- Import and inspect data

:::{.callout-important}
The principles you learned in the Data Management module will apply here as well: we should do our best to ensure that our projects won't just work today but can also be reused and shared in the future. While doing this is not always easy, there are several best practices that can help us, and one of the most important is to start with a good, organized code base.
:::

## Setting up your Project

### Folder Structure

::: {.setup}
If not done already, download the course folder and save it to a location that is **not connected to OneDrive**.
:::

[OneDrive doesn't play well with R as it will attempt to constantly synchronize certain project files in a way that can cause errors or memory problems.]{.aside}

This folder gives an example of a typical (and highly recommended) structure for your code projects:

- 📁 data 
  - 📁 clean 
  - 📁 raw 
- 📁 R 
- 📁 Rmd 
- 📁 outputs
- README

This folder will be you working directory for **all the sessions of this course**. You will create an Rstudio project (explanations below) in it, and save all your scripts in `/R`. The course datasets are already in `data/raw`. Additionaly, there are a couple of resources (pdfs and links to online books) in the `/resources` subfolder.


### Definitions {#sec-definitions}

To better understand the concepts from the rest, you need to understand the two following concepts:

**Working directory.** The working directory is the location (folder) where your R session is *actively working*. If you save a file, for example, it will be saved into this folder by default. Similarly, when you want to open a file, this folder will be shown by default. All relative paths (which will be explained in @sec-filepaths) will be relative to this <span class= 'hoverinfo' data-toggle= 'tooltip' title='By default, R usually picks the "Documents" folder as the working directory on Windows machines'>working directory</span>.

**Root.** The root refers to the top-most folder level of the working directory. If your course folder was called `FETCHR`, the root would then be directly inside it (as opposed to being inside one of its subfolders like `R` or `Data`).

### RStudio Projects

An RStudio Project can be used to make your life easier and help orient <span class= 'hoverinfo' data-toggle= 'tooltip' title='Technically an RStudio Project is just a file containing some metadata that tell RStudio what files to open and where to set your working directory. It will spare you the headache of managing the working directory yourself'>RStudio around the various files used in your code</span>.

As a quick reminder, your interface should look something like this:

![Screenshot of a typical Rstudio interface](../sessions_core/img/intro_001_rstudio_interface_screenshot_EN.png){fig-align="center" #fig-interface}

::: {.setup}
Open RStudio and create a new project by clicking `File > New Project > Existing Directory > Browse`, navigating into (opening) the course folder, and clicking `Create Project`.
:::

::: {.look}
In the Windows Explorer, look at the course folder. You should now see a new file with the extention `.Rproj` that has a small blue icon with an R in it.
:::

:::{.callout-note}
If you don't see this file, it's probably because it is hidden by default on your computer. To change this setting in Windows Explorer, go into the *View* menu and select `Filename Extensions`.
:::

![Icon associated with RStudio projects](../sessions_core/img/import_001_rstudio_project_icon.png){fig-align="center"}


When you open an RStudio Project, RStudio will start a new R session, open the associated project files, and **set your working directory to the root of the course folder**. At this time, RStudio will also display the subfolders of this directory in the panel on the bottom right.


::: {.callout-tip}
It is strongly recommended to set up a separate RStudio Project for each of your <span class='hoverinfo' data-toggle='tooltip' title="Here a single analysis would involve the full process of loading, cleaning, analyzing, and reporting on a dataset.">analyses</span> to ensure that your project files remain orgnaized and managable.  
:::

There are several ways to open an RStudio Project, including:

- Using the RStudio menu `File > Open Project` and then selecting the relevant `.Rproj` file
- Clicking on <span class='hoverinfo' data-toggle='tooltip' title="You can also refer to this button at any time to see which project you are currently working in.">the `Project: (none)` button</span> on the top right of the RStudio interface (see @fig-interface)
- Navigating in the folder explorer to the analysis folder and double clicking on the file with the `.Rproj` extension

### RStudio Options

Before continuing, let's update some of RStudio's problematic default settings:  

::: {.setup}
Open the global options (`Tools > Global Options`) and open the tab `General` (left menu). Make sure that *none* of the boxes in the sections `R Sessions`, `Workspace`, or `History` are checked.
:::

![Screenshot of the Rstudio options](../sessions_core/img/import_002_rstudio_options_do_not_save.png){fig-align="center"}

When checked, these options cause RStudio to save the objects in your environment and reload them as well as any files you previously had open when you open a new R session. While these default may seem like a good idea, it is better (especially as a beginner) to always start your work from a fresh, empty R session to avoid bugs.

:::{.callout-important}
Remember that any commands or outputs that is needed for the cleaning and analysis should be saved explicitly in a script, in the correct, functional order.
:::


## Creating a New Script

::: {.setup}
Open a new script and save it in the `R` folder of your project under the name `import_data.R`. 

Add some metadata to the top as seen in the first session using [comments](01_introduction.qmd#sec-comments). Be sure to include:

- Title
- Author
- Creation Date
- Description
:::

Now you're ready to start coding!

## Packages {#sec-packages}

Packages are collections of functions that extend the functionality of R. You'll use them **a lot**, both in this course and in your daily life. Fortunately, as an open source language, R packages can be downloaded and installed for free from the internet.

:::{.callout-note}
In R, packages are referenced using `{}`. For example `{ggplot2}` is the name of the ggplot2 package that contains new plotting functions such as `ggplot()`, `geom_point()` etc...
:::

### Installation

We can install a new package using the [function](../sessions_core/01_introduction.qmd#sec-functions) `install.packages()`, which downloads and installs it into the package library on your computer. This is done once per computer.

```{r}
#| eval = FALSE
install.packages("here") # install the {here} package
```

::: {.callout-important}
Don't forget to wrap the package name in quotation marks when using `install.packages()`. What happens if you don't do this?
:::

::: {.callout-note}
To avoid any potential internet connectivity issues during the training, we already had you install most of the course packages (including the one in the example below). 

If you have not installed the packages used in the course yet, you will have to manually do it each time you encounter a new package.
:::

### Usage

Once a package is installed we can use it but **we have to** specify to R that we will be using it every single session. This process is called *loading the package* and is achieved using the function `library()`. 

```{r}
library(here) # load the "here" package
```

::: {.write}
Use the `library()` function to load the packages `here` and `rio`, which will be used in @sec-import.
:::

```{r}
#| include = solutions
# SOLUTION
library(here)
library(rio)
```

::: {.callout-note}

Based on your computer's set up and the package you are trying to load, you may get a <span class='hoverinfo' data-toggle='tooltip' title='Unlike error messages, warnings will not cause R to stop an ongoing command. They are used to signal potential but not severe issues and do not always need to be fixed.'>warning message</span> noting that some functions have been <span class='hoverinfo' data-toggle='tooltip' title="Masking occurs when R tries to load more than one function with the same name at the same time. This issue is surprisingly common, for example, there are a large number of packages that have a function called `filter()` or `select()`. When these conflicts occur, R will pick whichever version was loaded last and the other versions will be ignored (masked).">masked</span> or that the current version of the package was built for a different version of R. These messages are not usually a problem but are still important to note.
:::

::: {.write}
Try to run the following code. Can you work out what the error means?

```{r}
#| error: true
library(ggplot)
```
:::

The above code throws an error because you have asked for a library that doesn't exist. Remember that R is **fickle and case sensitive** and many of your errors will come from small typos in the names of functions or objects. Here, for example, we wanted to load the package `ggplot2` but wrote `ggplot` instead.

::: {.callout-note}
Most of the time, you'll need to load a number of packages for your script and it is recommended to have a section at the start of your code that loads everything you'll need in one place:

```{r}
# Packages ----------------------------
library(tidyverse)   # data manipulation
library(lubridate)   # date manipulation
```

This practice makes it easy to tell which packages need to be installed to run a script.
:::

::: {.write}
Use <span class='hoverinfo' data-toggle='tooltip' title="Remember that you can use the keyboard shortcuts CRT+SHIT+C and CTRL+SHIFT+R to insert comments and sections" tooltip="top">comments</span> to create a "Packages" section to your script.
:::

### Updating Packages

R has a very active community of developers and it's pretty common for packages to be updated from time to time as their owners add in new functions and fix existing bugs. In order to update the packages in your library, you can go into the <span class='hoverinfo' data-toggle='tooltip' title="Remember that this tab shows a list of all the packages you have installed on your computer with their version numbers.">`Packages` tab</span> of the bottom right panel and click `Update`. Don't forget that you'll **need to be connected to the internet** during this process. 

::: {.callout-important}
Sometimes packages are updated in a way that might remove or change a function that you used in some of your scripts, causing your code to no longer work. **Don't panic** if this happens: it is always possible to go back and install an older version of a package if you need to. Details on how to do this are beyond the scope of this class, however, and we do note that the **best practice** is always to adapt *your code* rather than <span class='hoverinfo' data-toggle='tooltip' title="This is discouraged as it will make your code hard for others to use.">forcibly install an old version of a package</span>.
:::

## Data Importation

### Understanding File Paths {#sec-filepaths}

To open a file in R you need to provide a **file path**. A file path is simply a longer name for a file, that includes not only its name but also its location on your computer. There are several ways of defining these path, including *absolute* and *relative* paths.

#### Absolute Paths

Absolute paths are **specific to your computer** and create a file path that goes all the way up to the level of your <span tooltip-position="top" tooltip="For example, 'C:' or 'D:' on a Windows computer.">harddrive</span>. For example, an absolute path may look something like this: `D:/OneDrive - MSF/Documents/MATHILDE/1_MONITORING/CHOLERA/data/raw/exemple_linelist.xlsx`. Clearly, this path will only work on one computer.

The use of absolute paths is **strongly discouraged** as they would need to be changed every time your code is shared or the project folder is moved; if not, the code would no longer run properly.

#### Relative Paths

*Relative paths* are defined relative to your current working directory (@sec-definitions). For example, keeping in mind that our handy `.Rproj` file will set our working directory to the root of our project folder; we could create a relative path that looked like `data/raw/exemple_linelist.xlsx`. This means that **as long as we maintain the *internal* structure** of our project folder and have an `.Rproj` file our code would theoretically run on multiple computers.

::: {.callout-note}
**Foreshadowing.** File paths actually work a bit differently in `Rmarkdown` files than they do in `R` scripts, but this is something we will talk about much later in the course. If you don't know what `RMarkdown` is at the moment, don't worry about it.
:::

#### Robust Paths

While using a combination of relative paths and an RStudio project has fixed a lot of our problems, there are still a couple remaining issues. One is that different <span class='hoverinfo' data-toggle='tooltip' title="For example, Windows, MacOS, Debian..." tooltip-posiiton="top">operating systems</span> interpret characters like `/`, `\`, and `//` differently, meaning the file paths described above (whether relative or absolute) may not work across multiple systems. Fortunately, we have a few options.

The first is to use the base R function `file.path()`, which will accept a set of the relevant parts (folders) in your desired path and combine them into a file path using the syntax of your local operating system, whichever it is:

```{r}
#| eval: true
file.path("data", "raw", "exemple_linelist.xlsx")
```

Note that the path is relative, here to the current working directory

While `file.path()` works fine, the function `here()` (from the package `{here}`) works even better. One of the other outstanding problems with our relative path solution is that if ever we change our working directory during an R session the relative paths from our scripts will no longer be correct. `here` accepts a set of names in the same style as `file.path()` but will then use them to dynamically construct an absolute path adapted to your operating system and based on the location of your `.Rproj` file. In this course we **strongly encourage you** to use `here()` whenever you need to create a file path.

```{r}
#| eval: true
library(here)
here("data", "raw", "exemple_linelist.xlsx")
```


::: {.write}
Run the above code in the console. What file path does `here("data", "raw")` give you?
:::

We will often want to source multiple data files in a single project. To make that process easier, it can be helpful to create a variable with the path to your raw (or clean) data.

::: {.write}
Create a new section in your code called `File Paths`

Add the code to create an object called `path_data_raw` that contains the path to your raw data folder using the function `here()`.
:::

```{r}
#| include = solutions
# SOLUTION
library(here)
path_data_raw <- here("data", "raw")
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
path_data_raw <- here::here("data", "raw")
```

We can now pass our new variable `path_data_raw` back into `here()` in order to create a full path to a specific data file.

::: {.write}
Using `here()` and `path_data_raw`, create a complete filepath for the file `msf_linelist_moissala_2023-09-24.xlsx`.
:::

```{r}
#| include = solutions
# SOLUTION
here(path_data_raw, "msf_linelist_moissala_2023-09-24.xlsx")
```

::: {.callout-note}
`here()` simply creates a file path stored in a string, it doesn't actually check if a file exists on your computer. What is more, any typos in the file or folder names will result in an error. If you would like to use a function to check if a file exists, check out `file.exists()` function.
:::

### Import function {#sec-import}

In R different file formats are often imported using different, often specialized, functions. This can be tedious as it requires you to memorize and load a large number of functions just to get your data imported. To avoid this problem, we recommend that you use the `import()` function from the package <span tooltip-position="top" tooltip="`rio` stands for R Inputs and Outputs.">`{rio}`</span>. This function is able to open a large variety of files (including Excel, csv, Stata, and many others) by recognizing the file extension of your data and calling a relevant specialized function from another package so that you don't have to. [This type of function, providing an unified interface to other specific functions is known as a *wrapper*]{.aside}.

::: {.callout-tip}
To see the full list of all the file types you can load (and save!) with `rio`, check out their [website](https://gesistsa.github.io/rio/index.html) and in particular the list of [supported formats](https://gesistsa.github.io/rio/index.html#supported-file-formats). In the rest of the lesson we will focus on importing data from Excel `.xlsx` files and `.csv` text files.
:::

::: {.callout-note}
Because `import()` is actually just calling other functions in the background, it is possible that it will need different arguments depending on the type of file you want to load.
:::

#### Importing `.xlsx` files

##### From the First Sheet

In general, the usage of `import()` is pretty simple:

```{r}
import(file = here(path_data_raw, "exemple_linelist.xlsx"))
```

Notice that we have nested the command `here()` **inside** the `import()` command. Nesting functions is absolutely allowed in R and is something you will do *all the time*. When functions are nested, R will evaluate them in the order of the innermost function (in this case `here()`) to the outermost (in this case `import()`). In this way, the *output* of `here()` is being used as the *input* of `import()`. 

::: {.write}
Import the file `msf_linelist_moissala_2023-09-24.xlsx` that is in your raw data subfolder into R using `here()` and `import()`.
:::

If your import worked correctly, R will print the data into the console but not save it into the environment because we have not [assigned them to an object](../sessions_core/01_introduction.qmd#sec-assignement-operator).

::: {.callout-tip}
You may not want to have R print very large datasets into the console and assign them directly to an object.
:::

::: {.write}
Reimport your data but this time save it to an object called `df_linelist`.
:::

```{r}
#| include = solutions
# SOLUTION
df_linelist <- import(
  file = here(path_data_raw,
              "msf_linelist_moissala_2023-09-24.xlsx"))
```

##### From Any Sheet

As you just saw, R selects the first sheet by default. It is however possible to pass the number (or name) of a specific worksheet in your Excel data to `import()` using the argument `which`:

```{r}
import(file = here(path_data_raw, "exemple_linelist.xlsx"),
       which = 2)
```

::: {.callout-note}
The `which` argument is specific to the file types that have multiple sheets, such as an Excel or .Rdata file. If you try to use it on a `.csv` file the argument will be ignored.
:::


#### Importing `.csv` files

We can import a `.csv` file in exactly the same way as an `.xlsx` file, we need only change the extension:

```{r}
import(file = here(path_data_raw, "exemple_linelist.csv"))
```

`.csv` files sometimes use different <span tooltip-position="top" tooltip="A delimiter is the character used in a csv file to separate values. Many countries use a comma (,), but some use a semicolon (;).">delimiters</span> and <span tooltip-position="top" tooltip="Some countries use a decimal point (.) to indicate a number with a decimal, others will use a comma (,). Typically, countries using a comma for decimals will use a semicolon as a delimiter.">decimal characters</span> depending on where the file comes from. You can indicate to `import()` which characters to use for these using the `sep` and `dec` arguments respectively:

```{r}
import(file = here(path_data_raw, "exemple_linelist.csv"),
       sep = ";",
       dec = ",")
```

::: {.write}
Import the file `msf_linelist_moissala_2023-09-24.csv` from the raw data folder and store it in an object called `df_linelist_csv`.
:::

```{r}
#| include = solutions
# SOLUTION
df_linelist_csv <- import(file = here(path_data_raw,
                   "msf_linelist_moissala_2023-09-24.csv"))
```

## Taking a Look at your Data

We have now imported a dataset into R and assigned it to a dataframe (`df_linelist`). The natural next step is to inspect this dataset, to check that the import went well, get to know it a bit better, and assess if it requires any cleaning before analysis. 

### Useful Functions

We can start by taking a quick look at the first few lines of the dataframe using the function `head()`. This function takes a dataframe as its first argument and optionally accepts a second argument `n` indicating the number of lines we would like to see. 

```{r}
head(df_linelist, n = 6)
```
Actually, the default value of `n` is already 6, meaning our above code was equivalent to `head(df_linelist)`.[You can check the default value of an argument (if it exists) by checking the documentation of a function. We well show you how to do this in a later session, but you can read a bit [here](https://www.r-project.org/help.html) if you are dying to know.]{.aside}


::: {.write}
Use `head()` to examine the first 12 lines of `df_linelist`.
::: 

```{r}
#| include = solutions
# SOLUTION
head(df_linelist, n = 12)
```

We can also use the functions we learned in the [introduction session](../sessions_core/01_introduction.qmd#sec-dataframe-functions) to learn more about the shape of our dataframe and the type of data it contains. 

::: {.write}
Using `dim()` and `names()`, check the dimensions and column names of `df_linelist`. Do these results match what you see when you open the data in Excel? 
:::

```{r}
#| include = solutions
# SOLUTION
dim(df_linelist)
names(df_linelist)
```

::: {.write}
Use `str()` to check the data type of each column. Does anything look odd? Remember that you can also use functions like `is.character()` and `is.numeric()` if you'd like to test the type of a particular column.
:::

```{r}
#| include = solutions
# SOLUTION
str(df_linelist)
```

### The Environment

We can also check out our data by looking at the *Environment* tab of the top-right panel. Here, we can see our dataframe in the environment and look at its <span tooltip-position="top" tooltip="This is the same as using the command `str()`">structure</span>. 

::: {.write}
Click on the round blue button next to `df_linelist` in your environment to see its structure.
:::

### The Viewer

::: {.write}
Click on the name of your dataframe in the Environment tab. This should open the dataset in a new tab in the same corner as your script (top left).
:::

The *Viewer* displays dataframes as tables and is a convenient way to quickly look at your data. You can even sort and filter your data in the *Viewer*, though be aware that these actions will not make any changes to the actual object `df_linelist`. The *Viewer* can also be opened by using the function `View()`.

::: {.write}
Open `df_linelist` in the viewer using the function `View()`. 
:::

```{r}
#| include = solutions
# SOLUTION
View(df_linelist)
```

::: {.callout-note} 
The overwhelming majority of buttons in RStudio are actually just convenient shortcuts for R functions that are run in the background, as we have now seen in the case of `View()` and `str()`.
:::

### Data Summaries

The function `summary` accepts a dataframe and is a handy way to get some quick statistics on each of the columns in a dataset:

```{r}
summary(iris)
```

::: {.write}
Use `summary()` to inspect the minimum and maximum values for each column in `df_linelist`. Do you notice anything odd?
:::

```{r}
#| include = solutions
# SOLUTION
summary(df_linelist)
```

Make notes of types of data that you think is not correct and of values to check later, it will save you time in the next session.

## Done !

Don't forget to save your code!
