This is the repo for the revision of the FETCH R course *and* the development of a broader set of R training material for MSF/Epicentre. The ultimate goal is to have a website hosting self contained tutorials providing two possible learning pathways:
1. **Linear:** A specific set of ordered core sessions designed to take students from zero to basic competency
2. **Choose-Your-Own-Adventure**: A repository of core and satellite sessions ranging from basic to advanced topics.

Note, this website is **public** with a **[live development version online](https://epicentre-msf.github.io/repicentre/)**.

## Contribution Protocol
For all modifications, please do the following:
1. create a branch linked to the issue you are working on using the format `#[issue number]_[short title of issue]`
2. when you are happy with the branch, submit a pull request for review
3. done !

 For example, if I want to create a branch to work on issue 2 where the issue is about setting up a satillite about advanced date handling, I would use the name: `#2_satillite_dates`. **Note that the `#` appears in the title of the branch.** Alternatively, you can also have [github create the branch for you](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/creating-a-branch-for-an-issue).

Branches and their associated issues are intended to be **self contained**. This means that the commits associated with a particular issue branch should only be related to **that** issue. If you are working on multiple issues at the same time, please make sure that each of your commits goes on the appropriate branch. For example, if your work on one issue reminds you of something to change related to another one, you should **first switch to the assiciated branch** before making any changes.

**Note.** The main is **protected**, meaning that all modifications must go through a pull request with review by a code owner. This is to protect the main from getting messy or breaking, particularly as it feeds the live website. If you would like to be a code owner, talk to Cat.

## Project Page
To facilitate project management, this repo has an associated [github project](https://github.com/orgs/epicentre-msf/projects/5/views/6)

Feel free to add new issues whenever they seem relevant (or add comments to existing issues). Many tags are available (including core/session tags as well as things like "help wanted"). For issues that you own, please give an estimate of the number of days you expect to use slash how many you ultimately used. This will help to make sure we are within the budget.
