```{r setup}
#| include: false
#| eval: true
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE)

library(here) # for filepaths
library(rio)  # import and export files

df_linelist <- import(file = here("data", "raw", "xlsx",
              "Moissalla-measles-linelist-EN.xlsx"))
```

## Objectives

- Create a RStudio Project 
- Set up an organized and well documented code 
- Install and load packages
- Write robust file paths   
- Import and inspect data

The principles you learned in the [Introduction to R](01_introduction.html) session will apply here as well: we should do our best to ensure that our projects won't just work today but can also be reused and shared in the future. While doing this is not always easy, there are several best practices that can help us, and one of the most important is to start with a good, organized code base.
